          <p>Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict</p>
          <p/>
          <p>The High Contracting Parties,</p>
          <p><i>Recognizing</i> that cultural property has suffered grave damage during recent armed conflicts and <eol/>that, by reason of the developments in the technique of warfare, it is in increasing danger of <eol/>destruction;</p>
          <p/>
          <p><i>Being convinced</i> that damage to cultural property belonging to any people whatsoever means <eol/>damage to the cultural heritage of all mankind, since each people makes its contribution to the <eol/>culture of the world;</p>
          <p/>
          <p><i>Considering</i> that the preservation of the cultural heritage is of great importance for all peoples <eol/>of the world and that it is important that this heritage should receive international protection;</p>
          <p><i>Guided</i> by the principles concerning the protection of cultural property during armed conflict, <eol/>as established in the Conventions of The Hague of 1899 and of 1907 and in the Washington <eol/>Pact of 15 April 1935;</p>
          <p/>
          <p><i>Being of the opinion</i> that such protection cannot be effective unless both national and <eol/>international measures have been taken to organize it in time of peace;</p>
          <p/>
          <p><i>Being determined</i> to take all possible steps to protect cultural property;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>Have agreed upon the following provisions:</p>
          <p/>
          <p>CHAPTER I </p>
          <p>GENERAL PROVISIONS REGARDING PROTECTION</p>
          <p>Definition of Cultural Property</p>
          <p>Article 1</p>
          <p>For the purposes of the present Convention, the term "cultural property" shall cover, <eol/>irrespective of origin or ownership:</p>
          <p/>
          <p>(a) movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people, <eol/>such as monuments of architecture, art or history, whether religious or secular; archaeological <eol/>sites; groups of buildings which, as a whole, are of historical or artistic interest; works of art; <eol/>manuscripts, books and other objects of artistic, historical or archaeological interest; as well as <eop/>scientific collections and important collections of books or archives or of reproductions of the <eol/>property defined above;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>(b) buildings whose main and effective purpose is to preserve or exhibit the movable cultural <eol/>property defined in sub-paragraph (a) such as museums, large libraries and depositories of <eol/>archives, and refuges intended to shelter, in the event of armed conflict, the movable cultural <eol/>property defined in subparagraph (a);</p>

          <p>(c) centres containing a large amount of cultural property as defined in sub-paragraphs (a) and <eol/>(b), to be known as "centres containing monuments".</p>
          <p>Protection of Cultural Property</p>
          <p>Article 2</p>
          <p>For the purposes of the present Convention, the protection of cultural property shall comprise <eol/>the safeguarding of and respect for such property.</p>
          <p>Safeguarding of Cultural Property</p>
          <p>Article 3</p>
          <p>The High Contracting Parties undertake to prepare in time of peace for the safeguarding of <eol/>cultural property situated within their own territory against the foreseeable effects of an armed <eol/>conflict, by taking such measures as they consider appropriate.</p>
          <p>Respect for Cultural Property</p>
          <p>Article 4</p>
          <p>1. The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect cultural property situated within their own <eol/>territory as well as within the territory of other High Contracting Parties by refraining from any <eol/>use of the property and its immediate surroundings or of the appliances in use for its protection <eol/>for purposes which are likely to expose it to destruction or damage in the event of armed <eol/>conflict; and by refraining from any act of hostility directed against such property.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. The obligations mentioned in paragraph I of the present Article may be waived only in cases <eol/>where military necessity imperatively requires such a waiver.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>3. The High Contracting Parties further undertake to prohibit, prevent and, if necessary, put a <eol/>stop to any form of theft, pillage or misappropriation of, and any acts of vandalism directed <eol/>against, cultural property. They shall, refrain from requisitioning movable cultural property <eol/>situated in the territory of another High Contracting Party.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>4. They shall refrain from any act directed by way of reprisals against cultural property.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>5. No High Contracting Party may evade the obligations incumbent upon it under the present <eop/>Article, in respect of another High Contracting Party, by reason of the fact that the latter has not <eol/>applied the measures of safeguard referred to in Article 3.</p>
          <p>Occupation</p>
          <p>Article 5</p>
          <p>1. Any High Contracting Party in occupation of the whole or part of the territory of another <eol/>High Contracting Party shall as far as possible support the competent national authorities of the <eol/>occupied country in safeguarding and preserving its cultural property.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. Should it prove necessary to take measures to preserve cultural property situated in occupied <eol/>territory and damaged by military operations, and should the competent national authorities be <eol/>unable to take such measures, the Occupying Power shall, as far as possible, and in close co-<eol/>operation with such authorities, take the most necessary measures of preservation.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>3. Any High Contracting Party whose government is considered their legitimate government by <eol/>members of a resistance movement, shall, if possible, draw their attention to the obligation to <eol/>comply with those provisions of the Conventions dealing with respect for cultural property. </p>
          <p>Distinctive Marking of Cultural Property</p>
          <p>Article 6</p>
          <p>In accordance with the provisions of Article 16, cultural property may bear a distinctive <eol/>emblem so as to facilitate its recognition.</p>
          <p>Military Measures</p>
          <p>Article 7</p>
          <p>1. The High Contracting Parties undertake to introduce in time of peace into their military <eol/>regulations or instructions such provisions as may ensure observance of the present <eol/>Convention, and to foster in the members of their armed forces a spirit of respect for the culture <eol/>and cultural property of all peoples.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. The High Contracting Parties undertake to plan or establish in peacetime, within their armed <eol/>forces, services or specialist personnel whose purpose will be to secure respect for cultural <eol/>property and to co-operate with the civilian authorities responsible for safeguarding it.</p>
          <p>CHAPTER II</p>
          <p>SPECIAL PROTECTION</p>
          <p>Granting of Special Protection</p>
          <p>Article 8</p>
          <p>1. There may be placed under special protection a limited number of refuges intended to shelter <eol/>movable cultural property in the event of armed conflict, of centres containing monuments and <eol/>other immovable cultural property of very great importance, provided that they:</p>
          <p/>
          <p>(a) are situated at an adequate distance from any large industrial centre or from any important <eol/>military objective constituting a vulnerable point, such as, for example, an aerodrome, <eol/>broadcasting station, establishment engaged upon work of national defence, a port or railway <eol/>station of relative importance or a main line of communication;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>(b) are not used for military purposes.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. A refuge for movable cultural property may also be placed under special protection, whatever <eol/>its location, if it is so constructed that, in all probability, it will not be damaged by bombs.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>3. A centre containing monuments shall be deemed to be used for military purposes whenever it <eol/>is used for the movement of military personnel or material, even in transit. The same shall apply <eol/>whenever activities directly connected with military operations, the stationing of military <eol/>personnel, or the production of war material are carried on within the centre.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>4. The guarding of cultural property mentioned in paragraph I above by armed custodians <eol/>specially empowered to do so, or the presence, in the vicinity of such cultural property, of <eol/>police forces normally responsible for the maintenance of public order, shall not be deemed to <eol/>be used for military purposes.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>5. If any cultural property mentioned in paragraph I of the present Article is situated near an <eol/>important military objective as defined in the said paragraph, it may nevertheless be placed <eol/>under special protection if the High Contracting Party asking for that protection undertakes, in <eol/>the event of armed conflict, to make no use of the objective and particularly, in the case of a <eol/>port, railway station or aerodrome, to divert all traffic therefrom. In that event, such diversion <eol/>shall be prepared in time of peace.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>6. Special protection is granted to cultural property by its entry in the "International Register of <eol/>Cultural Property under Special Protection". This entry shall only be made, in accordance with <eol/>the provisions of the present Convention and under the conditions provided for in the <eol/>Regulations for the execution of the Convention.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>Immunity of Cultural Property under Special Protection</p>
          <p>Article 9</p>
          <p>The High Contracting Parties undertake to ensure the immunity of cultural property under <eol/>special protection by refraining, from the time of entry in the International Register, from any <eol/>act of hostility directed against such property and, except for the cases provided for in <eol/>paragraph 5 of Article 8, from any use of such property or its surroundings for military <eol/>purposes. </p>
          <p>Identification and Control</p>
          <p>Article 10</p>
          <p>During an armed conflict, cultural property under special protection shall be marked with the <eol/>distinctive emblem described in Article 16, and shall be open to international control as <eol/>provided for in the Regulations for the execution of the Convention.</p>
          <p>Withdrawal of Immunity</p>
          <p>Article 11</p>
          <p>1. If one of the High Contracting Parties commits, in respect of any item of cultural property <eol/>under special protection, a violation of the obligations under Article 9, the opposing Party shall, <eol/>so long as this violation persists, be released from the obligation to ensure the immunity of the <eol/>property concerned. Nevertheless, whenever possible, the latter Party shall first request the <eol/>cessation of such violation within a reasonable time.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. Apart from the case provided for in paragraph I of the present Article, immunity shall be <eol/>withdrawn from cultural property under special protection only in exceptional cases of <eol/>unavoidable military necessity, and only for such time as that necessity continues. Such <eol/>necessity can be established only by the officer commanding a force the equivalent of a division <eol/>in size or larger. Whenever circumstances permit, the opposing Party shall be notified, a <eol/>reasonable time in advance, of the decision to withdraw immunity.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>3. The Party withdrawing immunity shall, as soon as possible, so inform the Commissioner-<eol/>General for cultural property provided for in the Regulations for the execution of the <eol/>Convention, in writing, stating the reasons.</p>
          <p>CHAPTER III</p>
          <p>TRANSPORT OF CULTURAL PROPERTY</p>
          <p>Transport under Special Protection</p>
          <p>Article 12</p>
          <p>1. Transport exclusively engaged in the transfer of cultural property, whether within a territory <eol/>or to another territory, may, at the request of the High Contracting Party concerned, take place <eol/>under special protection in accordance with the conditions specified in the Regulations for the <eol/>execution of the Convention.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. Transport under special protection shall take place under the international supervision <eol/>provided for in the aforesaid Regulations and shall display the distinctive emblem described in <eol/>Article 16.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>3. The High Contracting Parties shall refrain from any act of hostility directed against transport <eol/>under special protection.</p>
          <p>Transport in Urgent Cases</p>
          <p>Article 13</p>
          <p>1. If a High Contracting Party considers that the safety of certain cultural property requires its <eol/>transfer and that the matter is of such urgency that the procedure laid down in Article 12 cannot <eol/>be followed, especially at the beginning of an armed conflict, the transport may display the <eol/>distinctive emblem described in Article 16, provided that an application for immunity referred <eol/>to in Article 12 has not already been made and refused. As far as possible, notification of <eol/>transfer should be made to the opposing Parties. Nevertheless, transport conveying cultural <eol/>property to the territory of another country may not display the distinctive emblem unless <eol/>immunity has been expressly granted to it.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. The High Contracting Parties shall take, so far as possible, the necessary precautions to avoid <eol/>acts of hostility directed against the transport described in paragraph 1 of the present Article <eol/>and displaying the distinctive emblem.</p>
          <p>Immunity from Seizure, Capture and Prize</p>
          <p>Article 14</p>
          <p>1. Immunity from seizure, placing in prize, or capture shall be granted to:</p>
          <p/>
          <p>(a) cultural property enjoying the protection provided for in Article 12 or that provided for in <eol/>Article 13;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>(b) the means of transport exclusively engaged in the transfer of such cultural property.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. Nothing in the present Article shall limit the right of visit and search.</p>
          <p>CHAPTER IV</p>
          <p>PERSONNEL</p>
          <p>Personnel</p>
          <p>Article 15</p>
          <p>As far as is consistent with the interests of security, personnel engaged in the protection of <eol/>cultural property shall, in the interests of such property, be respected and, if they fall into the <eol/>hands of the opposing Party, shall be allowed to continue to carry out duties whenever the <eol/>cultural property for which they are responsible has also fallen into the hands of the opposing <eol/>Party.</p>
          <p>CHAPTER V</p>
          <p>THE DISTINCTIVE EMBLEM</p>
          <p>Emblem of the Convention</p>
          <p>Article 16</p>
          <p>1. The distinctive emblem of the Convention shall take the form of a shield, pointed below, per <eol/>saltire blue and white (a shield consisting of a royal-blue square, one of the angles of which <eol/>forms the point of the shield, and of a royal-blue triangle above the square, the space on either <eol/>side being taken up by a white triangle).</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. The emblem shall be used alone, or repeated three times in a triangular formation (one shield <eol/>below), under the conditions provided for in Article 17.</p>
          <p>Use of the Emblem</p>
          <p>Article 17</p>
          <p>1. The distinctive emblem repeated three times may be used only as a means of identification <eol/>of:</p>
          <p/>
          <p>(a) immovable cultural property under special protection;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>(b) the transport of cultural property under the conditions provided for in Articles 12 and 13:</p>
          <p/>

          <p>of the Convention.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. The distinctive emblem may be used alone only as a means of identification of:</p>

          <p>3. During an armed conflict, the use of the distinctive emblem in any other cases than those <eol/>mentioned in the preceding paragraphs of the present Article, and the use for any purpose <eol/>whatever of a sign resembling the distinctive emblem, shall be forbidden.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>4. The distinctive emblem may not be placed on any immovable cultural property unless at the <eol/>same time there is displayed an authorization duly dated and signed by the competent authority <eol/>of the High Contracting Party.</p>

          <p>Any High Contracting Party may, at the time of ratification or accession, or at any time <eol/>thereafter, declare by notification addressed to the Director-General of the United Nations <eol/>Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, that the present Convention shall extend to <eol/>all or any of the territories for whose international relations it is responsible. The said <eol/>notification shall take effect three months after the date of its receipt.</p>
          <p>Relation to Previous Conventions</p>
          <p>Article 36</p>
          <p>1. In the relations between Powers which are bound by the Conventions of The Hague <eol/>concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land (IV) and concerning Naval Bombardment in <eol/>Time of War (IX), whether those of 29 July 1899 or those of 18 October 1907, and which are <eol/>Parties to the present Convention, this last Convention shall be supplementary to the <eol/>aforementioned Convention (IX) and to the Regulations annexed to the aforementioned <eol/>Convention (IV) and shall substitute for the emblem described in Article 5 of the <eol/>aforementioned Convention (IX) the emblem described in Article 16 of the Present Convention, <eol/>in cases in which the present Convention and the Regulations for its execution provide for the <eol/>use of this distinctive emblem.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. In the relations between Powers which are bound by the Washington Pact of 15 April 1935 <eol/>for the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and of Historic Monuments (Roerich <eol/>Pact) and which are Parties to the present Convention, the latter Convention shall be <eol/>supplementary to the Roerich Pact and shall substitute for the distinguishing flag described in <eol/>Article III of the Pact the emblem defined in Article 16 of the present Convention, in cases in <eol/>which the present Convention and the Regulations for its execution provide for the use of this <eol/>distinctive emblem.</p>
          <p>Denunciation</p>
          <p>Article 37</p>
          <p>1. Each High Contracting Party may denounce the present Convention, on its own behalf, or on <eol/>behalf of any territory for whose international relations it is responsible.</p>

          <p>2. The denunciation shall be notified by an instrument in writing, deposited with the Director-<eol/>General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>3. The denunciation shall take effect one year after the receipt of the instrument of <eol/>denunciation. However, if, on the expiry of this period, the denouncing Party is involved in an <eol/>armed conflict, the denunciation shall not take effect until the end of hostilities, or until the <eol/>operations of repatriating cultural property are completed, whichever is the later.</p>
          <p>Notifications</p>
          <p>Article 38</p>
          <p>The Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization <eol/>shall inform the States referred to in Articles 30 and 32, as well as the United Nations, of the <eol/>deposit of all the instruments of ratification, accession or acceptance provided for in Articles <eol/>31, 32 and 39 and of the notifications and denunciations provided for respectively in Articles <eol/>35, 37 and 39.</p>

The text of any proposed amendment shall be communicated to <eol/>the Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization <eol/>who shall transmit it to each High Contracting Party with the request that such Party reply <eol/>within four months stating whether it:</p>
          <p/>

          <p>(c) favours the rejection of the proposed amendment without a Conference.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. The Director-General shall transmit the replies, received under paragraph I of the present <eol/>Article, to all High Contracting Parties.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>3. If all the High Contracting Parties which have, within the prescribed time-limit, stated their <eol/>views to the Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural <eol/>Organization, pursuant to paragraph 1 (b) of this Article, inform him that they favour <eol/>acceptance of the amendment without a Conference, notification of their decision shall be made <eol/>by the Director-General in accordance with Article 38. The amendment shall become effective <eol/>for all the High Contracting Parties on the expiry of ninety days from the date of such <eol/>notification.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>4. The Director-General shall convene a Conference of the High Contracting Parties to consider <eol/>the proposed amendment if requested to do so by more than one-third of the High Contracting <eol/>Parties.</p>

          <p/>
          <p>6. Acceptance by the High Contracting Parties of amendments to the Convention or to the <eol/>Regulations for its execution, which have been adopted by the Conference mentioned in <eol/>paragraphs 4 and 5, shall be effected by the deposit of a formal instrument with the Director-<eol/>General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>7. After the entry into force of amendments to the present Convention or to the Regulations for <eol/>its execution, only the text of the Convention or of the Regulations for its execution thus <eol/>amended shall remain open for ratification or accession.</p>
          <p/>

          <p>Article 1</p>
          <p>On the entry into force of the Convention, the Director-General of the United Nations <eol/>Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization shall compile an international list consisting <eol/>of all persons nominated by the High Contracting Parties as qualified to carry out the functions <eol/>of Commissioner-General for Cultural Property. On the initiative of the Director-General of the <eol/>United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, this list shall be periodically <eol/>revised on the basis of requests formulated by the High Contracting Parties.</p>
          <p>Organization of Control</p>
          <p>Article 2</p>
          <p>As soon as any High Contracting Party is engaged in an armed conflict to which Article 18 of <eol/>the Convention applies:</p>
          <p/>
          <p>(a) It shall appoint a representative for cultural property situated in its territory; if it is in <eol/>occupation of another territory, it shall appoint a special representative for cultural property <eol/>situated in that territory;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>(b) The Protecting Power acting for each of the Parties in conflict with such High Contracting <eol/>Party shall appoint delegates accredited to the latter in conformity with Article 3 below; </p>

          <p>Article 3</p>
          <p>The Protecting Power shall appoint its delegates from among the members of its diplomatic or <eol/>consular staff or, with the approval of the Party to which they will be accredited, from among <eol/>other persons.</p>

          <p>Article 4</p>
          <p>1. The Commissioner-General for Cultural Property shall be chosen from the international list <eop/>of persons by joint agreement between the Party to which he will be accredited and the <eol/>Protecting Powers acting on behalf of the opposing Parties.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. Should the Parties fail to reach agreement within three weeks from the beginning of their <eol/>discussions on this point, they shall request the President of the International Court of Justice to <eol/>appoint the Commissioner-General, who shall not take up his duties until the Party to which he <eol/>is accredited has approved his appointment.</p>
          <p>Functions of Delegates</p>
          <p>Article 5</p>
          <p>The delegates of the Protecting Powers shall take note of violations of the Convention, <eol/>investigate, with the approval of the Party to which they are accredited, the circumstances in <eol/>which they have occurred, make representations locally to secure their cessation and, if <eol/>necessary, notify the Commissioner-General of such violations. They shall keep him informed <eol/>of their activities.</p>
          <p>Functions of the Commissioner-General</p>
          <p>Article 6</p>
          <p>1. The Commissioner-General for Cultural Property shall deal with all matters referred to him <eol/>in connexion with the application of the Convention, in conjunction with the representative of <eol/>the Party to which he is accredited and with the delegates concerned.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. He shall have powers of decision and appointment in the cases specified in the present <eol/>Regulations.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>3. With the agreement of the Party to which he is accredited, he shall have the right to order an <eol/>investigation or to conduct it himself.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>4. He shall make any representations to the Parties to the conflict or to their Protecting Powers <eol/>which he deems useful for the application of the Convention.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>5. He shall draw up such reports as may be necessary on the application of the Convention and <eol/>communicate them to the Parties concerned and to their Protecting Powers. He shall send <eol/>copies to the Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural <eol/>Organization, who may make use only of their technical contents.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>6. If there is no protecting Power, the Commissioner-General shall exercise the functions of the <eol/>Protecting Power as laid down in Articles 21 and 22 of the Convention.</p>
          <p>Inspectors and Experts</p>
          <p>Article 7</p>
          <p>1. Whenever the Commissioner-General for Cultural Property considers it necessary, either at <eol/>the request of the delegates concerned or after consultation with them, he shall propose, for the <eol/>approval of the Party to which he is accredited, an inspector of cultural property to be charged <eol/>with a specific mission. An inspector shall be responsible only to the Commissioner-General.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. The Commissioner-General, delegates and inspectors may have recourse to the services of <eol/>experts, who will also be proposed for the approval of the Party mentioned in the preceding <eol/>paragraph.</p>
          <p>Discharge of the Mission of Control</p>
          <p>Article 8</p>
          <p>The Commissioners-General for Cultural Property, delegates of the Protecting Powers, <eol/>inspectors and experts shall in no case exceed their mandates. In particular, they shall take <eol/>account of the security needs of the High Contracting Party to which they are accredited and <eol/>shall in all circumstances act in accordance with the requirements of the military situation as <eol/>communicated to them by that High Contracting Party.</p>
          <p>Substitutes for Protecting Powers</p>
          <p>Article 9</p>
          <p>If a Party to the conflict does not benefit or ceases to benefit from the activities of a Protecting <eol/>Power, a neutral State may be asked to undertake those functions of a Protecting Power which <eol/>concern the appointment of a Commissioner-General for Cultural Property in accordance with <eol/>the procedure laid down in Article 4. The Commissioner-General thus appointed shall, if need <eol/>be, entrust to inspectors the functions of delegates of Protecting Powers as specified in the <eol/>present Regulations.</p>
          <p>Expenses</p>

          <p/>
          <p>CHAPTER II</p>
          <p>SPECIAL PROTECTION</p>
          <p>Improvised Refuges</p>
          <p>Article 11</p>
          <p>1. If, during an armed conflict, any High Contracting Party is induced by unforeseen <eol/>circumstances to set up an improvised refuge and desires that it should be placed under special <eop/>protection, it shall communicate this fact forthwith to the Commissioner-General accredited to <eol/>that Party.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. If the Commissioner-General considers that such a measure is justified by the circumstances <eol/>and by the importance of the cultural property sheltered in this improvised refuge, he may <eol/>authorize the High Contracting Party to display on such refuge the distinctive emblem defined <eol/>in Article 16 of the Convention. He shall communicate his decision without delay to the <eol/>delegates of the Protecting Powers who are concerned, each of whom may, within a time-limit <eol/>of 30 days, order the immediate withdrawal of the emblem.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>3. As soon as such delegates have signified their agreement or if the time-limit of 30 days has <eol/>passed without any of the delegates concerned having made an objection, and if, in the view of <eol/>the Commissioner-General, the refuge fulfils the conditions laid down in Article 8 of the <eol/>Convention, the Commissioner-General shall request the Director-General of the United <eol/>Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization to enter the refuge in the Register of <eol/>Cultural Property under Special Protection.</p>
          <p>International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection</p>
          <p>Article 12</p>
          <p>1. An "International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection" shall be prepared.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. The Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural <eol/>Organization shall maintain this Register. He shall furnish copies to the Secretary-General of <eol/>the United Nations and to the High Contracting Parties.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>3. The Register shall be divided into sections, each in the name of a High Contracting Party. <eol/>Each section shall be sub-divided into three paragraphs, headed: Refuges, Centres containing <eol/>Monuments, Other Immovable Cultural Property. The Director-General shall determine what <eol/>details each section shall contain.</p>
          <p>Requests for Registration</p>
          <p>Article 13</p>
          <p>1. Any High Contracting Party may submit to the Director-General of the United Nations <eol/>Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization an application for the entry in the Register of <eol/>certain refuges, centres containing monuments or other immovable cultural property situated <eol/>within its territory. Such application shall contain a description of the location of such property <eol/>and shall certify that the property complies with the provisions of Article 8 of the Convention.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. In the event of occupation, the Occupying Power shall be competent to make such <eol/>application.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>3. The Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural <eol/>Organization shall, without delay, send copies of applications for registration to each of the <eol/>High Contracting Parties.</p>
          <p>Objections</p>
          <p>Article 14</p>
          <p>1. Any High Contracting Party may, by letter addressed to the Director-General of the United <eol/>Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, lodge an objection to the registration <eol/>of cultural property. This letter must be received by him within four months of the day on which <eol/>he sent a copy of the application for registration.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. Such objection shall state the reasons giving rise to it, the only valid grounds being that:</p>
          <p/>
          <p>(a) the property is not cultural property;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>(b) the property does not comply with the conditions mentioned in Article 8 of the Convention.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>3. The Director-General shall send a copy of the letter of objection to the High Contracting <eol/>Parties without delay. He shall, if necessary, seek the advice of the International Committee on <eol/>Monuments, Artistic and Historical Sites and Archaeological Excavations and also, if he thinks <eol/>fit, of any other competent organization or person.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>4. The Director-General, or the High Contracting Party requesting registration, may make <eol/>whatever representations they deem necessary to the High Contracting Parties which lodged the <eol/>objection, with a view to causing the objection to be withdrawn.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>5. If a High Contracting Party which has made an application for registration in time of peace <eol/>becomes involved in an armed conflict before the entry has been made, the cultural property <eol/>concerned shall at once be provisionally entered in the Register, by the Director-General, <eol/>pending the confirmation, withdrawal or cancellation of any objection that may be, or may have <eol/>been, made.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>6. If, within a period of six months from the date of receipt of the letter of objection, the <eol/>Director-General has not received from the High Contracting Party lodging the objection a <eol/>communication stating that it has been withdrawn, the High Contracting Party applying for <eol/>registration may request arbitration in accordance with the procedure in the following <eol/>paragraph.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>7. The request for arbitration shall not be made more than one year after the date of receipt by <eol/>the Director-General of the letter of objection. Each of the two Parties to the dispute shall <eop/>appoint an arbitrator. When more than one objection has been lodged against an application for <eol/>registration, the High Contracting Parties which have lodged the objections shall, by common <eol/>consent, appoint a single arbitrator. These two arbitrators shall select a chief arbitrator from the <eol/>international list mentioned in Article I of the present Regulations. If such arbitrators cannot <eol/>agree upon their choice, they shall ask the President of the International Court of Justice to <eol/>appoint a chief arbitrator who need not necessarily be chosen from the international list. The <eol/>arbitral tribunal thus constituted shall fix its own procedure. There shall be no appeal from its <eol/>decisions.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>8. Each of the High Contracting Parties may declare, whenever a dispute to which it is a Party <eol/>arises, that it does not wish to apply the arbitration procedure provided for in the preceding <eol/>paragraph. In such cases, the objection to an application for registration shall be submitted by <eol/>the Director-General to the High Contracting Parties. The objection will be confirmed only if <eol/>the High Contracting Parties so decide by a two-third majority of the High Contracting Parties <eol/>voting. The vote shall be taken by correspondence, unless the Director-General of the United <eol/>Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization deems it essential to convene a <eol/>meeting under the powers conferred upon him by Article 27 of the Convention. If the Director-<eol/>General decides to proceed with the vote by correspondence, he shall invite the High <eol/>Contracting Parties to transmit their votes by sealed letter within six months from the day on <eol/>which they were invited to do so.</p>
          <p>Registration</p>
          <p>Article 15</p>
          <p>1. The Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural <eol/>Organization shall cause to be entered in the Register under a serial number, each item of <eol/>property for which application for registration is made, provided that he has not received an <eol/>objection within the time-limit prescribed in Paragraph I of Article 14.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. If an objection has been lodged, and without prejudice to the provision of paragraph 5 of <eol/>Article 14, the Director-General shall enter property in the Register only if the objection has <eol/>been withdrawn or has failed to be confirmed following the procedures laid down in either <eol/>paragraph 7 or paragraph 8 of Article 14.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>3. Whenever paragraph 3 of Article 11 applies, the Director-General shall enter property in the <eol/>Register if so requested by the Commissioner-General for Cultural Property.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>4. The Director-General shall send without delay to the Secretary-General of the United <eol/>Nations, to the High Contracting Parties, and, at the request of the Party applying for <eol/>registration, to all other States referred to in Articles 30 and 32 of the Convention, a certified <eol/>copy of each entry in the Register. Entries shall become effective thirty days after despatch of <eol/>such copies.</p>
          <p>Cancellation</p>
          <p>Article 16</p>
          <p>1. The Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural <eol/>Organization shall cause the registration of any property to be cancelled:</p>
          <p/>
          <p>(a) at the request of the High Contracting Party within whose territory the cultural property is <eol/>situated;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>(b) if the High Contracting Party which requested registration has denounced the Convention, <eol/>and when that denunciation has taken effect;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>(c) in the special case provided for in Article 14, paragraph 5, when an objection has been <eol/>confirmed following the procedures mentioned either in paragraph 7 or in paragraph 8 of <eol/>Article 14.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. The Director-General shall send without delay, to the Secretary-General of the United <eol/>Nations and to all States which received a copy of the entry in the Register, a certified copy of <eol/>its cancellation. Cancellation shall take effect thirty days after the despatch of such copies.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>CHAPTER III</p>
          <p>TRANSPORT OF CULTURAL PROPERTY</p>
          <p>Procedure to Obtain Immunity</p>
          <p>Article 17</p>
          <p>1. The request mentioned in paragraph 1 of Article 12 of the Convention shall be addressed to <eol/>the Commissioner-General for Cultural Property. It shall mention the reasons on which it is <eol/>based and specify the approximate number and the importance of the objects to be transferred, <eol/>their present location, the location now envisaged, the means of transport to be used, the route <eol/>to be followed, the date proposed for the transfer, and any other relevant information.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. If the Commissioner-General, after taking such opinions as he deems fit, considers that such <eol/>transfer is justified, he shall consult those delegates of the Protecting Powers who are <eol/>concerned, on the measures proposed for carrying it out. Following such consultation, he shall <eol/>notify the Parties to the conflict concerned of the transfer, including in such notification all <eol/>useful information.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>3. The Commissioner-General shall appoint one or more inspectors, who shall satisfy <eol/>themselves that only the property stated in the request is to be transferred and that the transport <eol/>is to be by the approved methods and bears the distinctive emblem. The inspector or inspectors <eop/>shall accompany the property to its destination.</p>
          <p>Transport Abroad</p>
          <p>Article 18</p>
          <p>Where the transfer under special protection is to the territory of another country, it shall be <eol/>governed not only by Article 12 of the Convention and by Article 17 of the present Regulations, <eol/>but by the following further provisions:</p>
          <p/>
          <p>(a) while the cultural property remains on the territory of another State, that State shall be its <eol/>depositary and shall extend to it as great a measure of care as that which it bestows upon its <eol/>own cultural property of comparable importance;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>(b) the depositary State shall return the property only on the cessation of the conflict; such <eol/>return shall be effected within six months from the date on which it was requested;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>(c) during the various transfer operations, and while it remains on the territory of another State, <eol/>the cultural property shall be exempt from confiscation and may not be disposed of either by <eol/>the depositor or by the depositary. Nevertheless, when the safety of the property requires it, the <eol/>depositary may, with the assent of the depositor, have the property transported to the territory of <eol/>a third country, under the conditions laid down in the present article;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>(d) the request for special protection shall indicate that the State to whose territory the property <eol/>is to be transferred accepts the provisions of the present Article.</p>
          <p>Occupied Territory</p>
          <p>Article 19</p>
          <p>Whenever a High Contracting Party occupying territory of another High Contracting Party <eol/>transfers cultural property to a refuge situated elsewhere in that territory, without being able to <eol/>follow the procedure provided for in Article 17 of the Regulations, the transfer in question shall <eol/>not be regarded as misappropriation within the meaning of Article 4 of the Convention, <eol/>provided that the Commissioner-General for Cultural Property certifies in writing, after having <eol/>consulted the usual custodians, that such transfer was rendered necessary by circumstances.</p>
          <p>CHAPTER IV</p>
          <p>THE DISTINCTIVE EMBLEM</p>
          <p>Affixing of the Emblem</p>
          <p>Article 20</p>
          <p>1. The placing of the distinctive emblem and its degree of visibility shall be left to the <eol/>discretion of the competent authorities of each High Contracting Party. It may be displayed on <eol/>flags or armlets; it may be painted on an object or represented in any other appropriate form.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. However, without prejudice to any possible fuller markings, the emblem shall, in the event of <eol/>armed conflict and in the cases mentioned in Articles 12 and 13 of the Convention, be placed on <eol/>the vehicles of transport so as to be clearly visible in daylight from the air as well as from the <eol/>ground. The emblem shall be visible from the ground:</p>
          <p/>
          <p>(a) at regular intervals sufficient to indicate clearly the perimeter of a centre containing <eol/>monuments under special protection;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>(b) at the entrance to other immovable cultural property under special protection.</p>
          <p>Identification of Persons</p>
          <p>Article 21</p>
          <p>1. The persons mentioned in Article 17, paragraph 2 (b) and (c) of the Convention may wear an <eol/>armlet bearing the distinctive emblem, issued and stamped by the competent authorities.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. Such persons shall carry a special identity card bearing the distinctive emblem. This card <eol/>shall mention at least the surname and first names, the date of birth, the title or rank, and the <eol/>function of the holder. The card shall bear the photograph of the holder as well as his signature <eol/>or his fingerprints, or both. It shall bear the embossed stamp of the competent authorities.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>3. Each High Contracting Party shall make out its own type of identity card, guided by the <eol/>model annexed, by way of example, to the present Regulations. The High Contracting Parties <eol/>shall transmit to each other a specimen of the model they are using. Identity cards shall be made <eol/>out, if possible, at least in duplicate, one copy being kept by the issuing Power.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>4. The said persons may not, without legitimate reason, be deprived of their identity card or of <eol/>the right to wear the armlet.</p>

          <p>Chapter 2</p>
          <p>General provisions regarding protection</p>
          <p>Article 5</p>
          <p>Safeguarding of cultural property</p>
          <p>Preparatory measures taken in time of peace for the safeguarding of cultural property against <eol/>the foreseeable effects of an armed conflict pursuant to Article 3 of the Convention shall <eol/>include, as appropriate, the preparation of inventories, the planning of emergency measures for <eol/>protection against fire or structural collapse, the preparation for the removal of movable <eol/>cultural property or the provision for adequate in situ protection of such property, and the <eol/>designation of competent authorities responsible for the safeguarding of cultural property.</p>
          <p>Article 6</p>
          <p>Respect for cultural property</p>
          <p>With the goal of ensuring respect for cultural property in accordance with Article 4 of the <eol/>Convention:</p>
          <p>a. a waiver on the basis of imperative military necessity pursuant to Article 4 paragraph 2 <eol/>of the Convention may only be invoked to direct an act of hostility against cultural <eol/>property when and for as long as:</p>
          <p/>
          <p>i. that cultural property has, by its function, been made into a military objective; and</p>
          <p/>
          <p>ii. there is no feasible alternative available to obtain a similar military advantage to <eol/>that offered by directing an act of hostility against that objective;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>b. a waiver on the basis of imperative military necessity pursuant to Article 4 paragraph 2 <eol/>of the Convention may only be invoked to use cultural property for purposes which are <eol/>likely to expose it to destruction or damage when and for as long as no choice is <eol/>possible between such use of the cultural property and another feasible method for <eol/>obtaining a similar military advantage;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>c. the decision to invoke imperative military necessity shall only be taken by an officer <eol/>commanding a force the equivalent of a battalion in size or larger, or a force smaller in <eol/>size where circumstances do not permit otherwise;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>d. in case of an attack based on a decision taken in accordance with sub-paragraph (a), an <eol/>effective advance warning shall be given whenever circumstances permit.</p>
          <p>Article 7</p>
          <p>Precautions in attack</p>
          <p>Without prejudice to other precautions required by international humanitarian law in the <eol/>conduct of military operations, each Party to the conflict shall:</p>
          <p/>
          <p>a. do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are not cultural <eol/>property protected under Article 4 of the Convention;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>b. take all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods of attack with a view <eol/>to avoiding, and in any event to minimizing, incidental damage to cultural property <eol/>protected under Article 4 of the Convention;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>c. refrain from deciding to launch any attack which may be expected to cause incidental <eol/>damage to cultural property protected under Article 4 of the Convention which would <eol/>be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated; and</p>
          <p/>
          <p>d. cancel or suspend an attack if it becomes apparent:</p>
          <p/>
          <p>i. that the objective is cultural property protected under Article 4 of the <eol/>Convention;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>ii. that the attack may be expected to cause incidental damage to cultural property <eol/>protected under Article 4 of the Convention which would be excessive in <eol/>relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.</p>
          <p>Article 8</p>
          <p>Precautions against the effects of hostilities</p>
          <p>The Parties to the conflict shall, to the maximum extent feasible:</p>
          <p>a. remove movable cultural property from the vicinity of military objectives or provide <eol/>for adequate in situ protection;</p>
          <p>b. avoid locating military objectives near cultural property.</p>
          <p>Article 9</p>
          <p>Protection of cultural property in occupied territory</p>
          <p>1. Without prejudice to the provisions of Articles 4 and 5 of the Convention, a Party in <eol/>occupation of the whole or part of the territory of another Party shall prohibit and prevent in <eol/>relation to the occupied territory:</p>
          <p/>
          <p>a. any illicit export, other removal or transfer of ownership of cultural property;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>b. any archaeological excavation, save where this is strictly required to safeguard, <eol/>record or preserve cultural property</p>
          <p/>
          <p>c. any alteration to, or change of use of, cultural property which is intended to conceal <eol/>or destroy cultural, historical or scientific evidence.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. Any archaeological excavation of, alteration to, or change of use of, cultural property in <eol/>occupied territory shall, unless circumstances do not permit, be carried out in close co-<eol/>operation with the competent national authorities of the occupied territory.</p>
          <p>Chapter 3</p>
          <p>Enhanced Protection</p>
          <p>Article 10</p>
          <p>Enhanced protection</p>
          <p>Cultural property may be placed under enhanced protection provided that it meets the following <eol/>three conditions:</p>
          <p>a. it is cultural heritage of the greatest importance for humanity;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>b. it is protected by adequate domestic legal and administrative measures recognising its <eol/>exceptional cultural and historic value and ensuring the highest level of protection;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>c. it is not used for military purposes or to shield military sites and a declaration has <eol/>been made by the Party which has control over the cultural property, confirming that it <eol/>will not be so used.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>Article 11</p>
          <p>The granting of enhanced protection</p>
          <p>1. Each Party should submit to the Committee a list of cultural property for which it intends to <eol/>request the granting of enhanced protection.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. The Party which has jurisdiction or control over the cultural property may request that it be <eol/>included in the List to be established in accordance with Article 27 sub-paragraph 1(b). This <eol/>request shall include all necessary information related to the criteria mentioned in Article 10. <eol/>The Committee may invite a Party to request that cultural property be included in the List.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>3. Other Parties, the International Committee of the Blue Shield and other non-governmental <eol/>organisations with relevant expertise may recommend specific cultural property to the <eol/>Committee. In such cases, the Committee may decide to invite a Party to request inclusion of <eol/>that cultural property in the List.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>4. Neither the request for inclusion of cultural property situated in a territory, sovereignty or <eol/>jurisdiction over which is claimed by more than one State, nor its inclusion, shall in any way <eol/>prejudice the rights of the parties to the dispute.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>5. Upon receipt of a request for inclusion in the List, the Committee shall inform all Parties of <eol/>the request. Parties may submit representations regarding such a request to the Committee <eol/>within sixty days. These representations shall be made only on the basis of the criteria <eol/>mentioned in Article 10. They shall be specific and related to facts. The Committee shall <eol/>consider the representations, providing the Party requesting inclusion with a reasonable <eol/>opportunity to respond before taking the decision. When such representations are before the <eol/>Committee, decisions for inclusion in the List shall be taken, notwithstanding Article 26, by a <eol/>majority of four-fifths of its members present and voting.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>6. In deciding upon a request, the Committee should ask the advice of governmental and non-<eol/>governmental organisations, as well as of individual experts.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>7. A decision to grant or deny enhanced protection may only be made on the basis of the criteria <eol/>mentioned in Article 10.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>8. In exceptional cases, when the Committee has concluded that the Party requesting inclusion <eol/>of cultural property in the List cannot fulfil the criteria of Article 10 sub-paragraph (b), the <eol/>Committee may decide to grant enhanced protection, provided that the requesting Party submits <eol/>a request for international assistance under Article 32.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>9. Upon the outbreak of hostilities, a Party to the conflict may request, on an emergency basis, <eol/>enhanced protection of cultural property under its jurisdiction or control by communicating this <eol/>request to the Committee. The Committee shall transmit this request immediately to all Parties <eol/>to the conflict. In such cases the Committee will consider representations from the Parties <eol/>concerned on an expedited basis. The decision to grant provisional enhanced protection shall be <eol/>taken as soon as possible and, notwithstanding Article 26, by a majority of four-fifths of its <eol/>members present and voting. Provisional enhanced protection may be granted by the Committee <eol/>pending the outcome of the regular procedure for the granting of enhanced protection, provided <eol/>that the provisions of Article 10 sub-paragraphs (a) and (c) are met.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>10. Enhanced protection shall be granted to cultural property by the Committee from the <eol/>moment of its entry in the List.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>11. The Director-General shall, without delay, send to the Secretary-General of the United <eol/>Nations and to all Parties notification of any decision of the Committee to include cultural <eol/>property on the List.</p>
          <p>Article 12</p>
          <p>Immunity of cultural property under enhanced protection</p>
          <p>The Parties to a conflict shall ensure the immunity of cultural property under enhanced <eol/>protection by refraining from making such property the object of attack from any use of the <eol/>property or its immediate surroundings in support of military action.</p>
          <p>Article 13</p>
          <p>Loss of enhanced protection</p>
          <p>1. Cultural property under enhanced protection shall only lose such protection:</p>
          <p/>
          <p>a. if such protection is suspended or cancelled in accordance with Article 14; or</p>
          <p/>
          <p>b. if, and for as long as, the property has, by its use, become a military objective.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. In the circumstances of sub-paragraph 1(b), such property may only be the object of attack if:</p>
          <p/>
          <p>a. the attack is the only feasible means of terminating the use of the property referred to <eol/>in sub-paragraph 1(b);</p>
          <p/>
          <p>b. all feasible precautions are taken in the choice of means and methods of attack, with a <eol/>view to terminating such use and avoiding, or in any event minimising, damage to the <eol/>cultural property;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>c. unless circumstances do not permit, due to requirements of immediate self-defence:</p>
          <p/>
          <p>i. the attack is ordered at the highest operational level of command;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>ii effective advance warning is issued to the opposing forces requiring the <eol/>termination of the use referred to in sub-paragraph 1(b); and</p>
          <p/>
          <p>iii. reasonable time is given to the opposing forces to redress the situation.</p>
          <p>Article 14</p>
          <p>Suspension and cancellation of enhanced protection</p>
          <p>1. Where cultural property no longer meets any one of the criteria in Article 10 of this Protocol, <eol/>the Committee may suspend its enhanced protection status or cancel that status by removing <eol/>that cultural property from the List.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. In the case of a serious violation of Article 12 in relation to cultural property under enhanced <eol/>protection arising from its use in support of military action, the Committee may suspend its <eol/>enhanced protection status. Where such violations are continuous, the Committee may <eol/>exceptionally cancel the enhanced protection status by removing the cultural property from the <eol/>List.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>3. The Director-General shall, without delay, send to the Secretary-General of the United <eol/>Nations and to all Parties to this Protocol notification of any decision of the Committee to <eol/>suspend or cancel the enhanced protection of cultural property.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>4. Before taking such a decision, the Committee shall afford an opportunity to the Parties to <eol/>make their views known.</p>
          <p>Chapter 4</p>
          <p>Criminal responsibility and jurisdiction</p>
          <p>Article 15</p>
          <p>Serious violations of this Protocol</p>
          <p>1. Any person commits an offence within the meaning of this Protocol if that person <eol/>intentionally and in violation of the Convention or this Protocol commits any of the following <eol/>acts:</p>
          <p/>
          <p>a. making cultural property under enhanced protection the object of attack;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>b. using cultural property under enhanced protection or its immediate surroundings in <eol/>support of military action;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>c. extensive destruction or appropriation of cultural property protected under the <eol/>Convention and this Protocol;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>d. making cultural property protected under the Convention and this Protocol the object <eol/>of attack;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>e. theft, pillage or misappropriation of, or acts of vandalism directed against cultural <eol/>property protected under the Convention.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. Each Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences <eol/>under its domestic law the offences set forth in this Article and to make such offences <eol/>punishable by appropriate penalties. When doing so, Parties shall comply with general <eol/>principles of law and international law, including the rules extending individual criminal <eol/>responsibility to persons other than those who directly commit the act.</p>
          <p>Article 16</p>
          <p>Jurisdiction</p>
          <p>1. Without prejudice to paragraph 2, each Party shall take the necessary legislative measures to <eol/>establish its jurisdiction over offences set forth in Article 15 in the following cases:</p>
          <p/>
          <p>a. when such an offence is committed in the territory of that State;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>b. when the alleged offender is a national of that State;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>c. in the case of offences set forth in Article 15 sub-paragraphs (a) to (c), when the <eol/>alleged offender is present in its territory.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. With respect to the exercise of jurisdiction and without prejudice to Article 28 of the <eol/>Convention:</p>
          <p>a. this Protocol does not preclude the incurring of individual criminal responsibility or <eol/>the exercise of jurisdiction under national and international law that may be <eol/>applicable, or affect the exercise of jurisdiction under customary international law;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>b. Except in so far as a State which is not Party to this Protocol may accept and apply its <eol/>provisions in accordance with Article 3 paragraph 2, members of the armed forces and <eol/>nationals of a State which is not Party to this Protocol, except for those nationals <eol/>serving in the armed forces of a State which is a Party to this Protocol, do not incur <eol/>individual criminal responsibility by virtue of this Protocol, nor does this Protocol <eol/>impose an obligation to establish jurisdiction over such persons or to extradite them.</p>
          <p>Article 17</p>
          <p>Prosecution</p>
          <p>1. The Party in whose territory the alleged offender of an offence set forth in Article 15 sub-<eol/>paragraphs 1 (a) to (c) is found to be present shall, if it does not extradite that person, submit, <eol/>without exception whatsoever and without undue delay, the case to its competent authorities, <eol/>for the purpose of prosecution, through proceedings in accordance with its domestic law or <eol/>with, if applicable, the relevant rules of international law.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. Without prejudice to, if applicable, the relevant rules of international law, any person <eol/>regarding whom proceedings are being carried out in connection with the Convention or this <eol/>Protocol shall be guaranteed fair treatment and a fair trial in accordance with domestic law and <eol/>international law at all stages of the proceedings, and in no cases shall be provided guarantees <eol/>less favourable to such person than those provided by international law.</p>
          <p>Article 18</p>
          <p>Extradition</p>
          <p>1. The offences set forth in Article 15 sub-paragraphs 1 (a) to (c) shall be deemed to be <eol/>included as extraditable offences in any extradition treaty existing between any of the Parties <eol/>before the entry into force of this Protocol. Parties undertake to include such offences in every <eol/>extradition treaty to be subsequently concluded between them.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. When a Party which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty receives a <eol/>request for extradition from another Party with which it has no extradition treaty, the requested <eop/>Party may, at its option, consider the present Protocol as the legal basis for extradition in <eol/>respect of offences as set forth in Article 15 sub-paragraphs 1 (a) to (c).</p>
          <p/>
          <p>3. Parties which do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall recognise <eol/>the offences set forth in Article 15 sub-paragraphs 1 (a) to (c) as extraditable offences between <eol/>them, subject to the conditions provided by the law of the requested Party.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>4. If necessary, offences set forth in Article 15 sub-paragraphs 1 (a) to (c) shall be treated, for <eol/>the purposes of extradition between Parties, as if they had been committed not only in the place <eol/>in which they occurred but also in the territory of the Parties that have established jurisdiction <eol/>in accordance with Article 16 paragraph 1.</p>
          <p>Article 19</p>
          <p>Mutual legal assistance</p>
          <p>1. Parties shall afford one another the greatest measure of assistance in connection with <eol/>investigations or criminal or extradition proceedings brought in respect of the offences set forth <eol/>in Article 15, including assistance in obtaining evidence at their disposal necessary for the <eol/>proceedings.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. Parties shall carry out their obligations under paragraph 1 in conformity with any treaties or <eol/>other arrangements on mutual legal assistance that may exist between them. In the absence of <eol/>such treaties or arrangements, Parties shall afford one another assistance in accordance with <eol/>their domestic law.</p>
          <p>Article 20</p>
          <p>Grounds for refusal</p>
          <p>1. For the purpose of extradition, offences set forth in Article 15 sub-paragraphs 1 (a) to (c), <eol/>and for the purpose of mutual legal assistance, offences set forth in Article 15 shall not be <eol/>regarded as political offences nor as offences connected with political offences nor as offences <eol/>inspired by political motives. Accordingly, a request for extradition or for mutual legal <eol/>assistance based on such offences may not be refused on the sole ground that it concerns a <eol/>political offence or an offence connected with a political offence or an offence inspired by <eol/>political motives.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>2. Nothing in this Protocol shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite or to <eol/>afford mutual legal assistance if the requested Party has substantial grounds for believing that <eol/>the request for extradition for offences set forth in Article 15 sub-paragraphs 1 (a) to (c) or for <eol/>mutual legal assistance with respect to offences set forth in Article 15 has been made for the <eol/>purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person's race, religion, <eol/>nationality, ethnic origin or political opinion or that compliance with the request would cause <eol/>prejudice to that person's position for any of these reasons.</p>
          <p>Article 21</p>
          <p>Measures regarding other violations</p>
          <p>Without prejudice to Article 28 of the Convention, each Party shall adopt such legislative, <eol/>administrative or disciplinary measures as may be necessary to suppress the following acts <eol/>when committed intentionally:</p>
          <p>a. any use of cultural property in violation of the Convention or this Protocol;</p>
          <p/>
          <p>b. any illicit export, other removal or transfer of ownership of cultural property from <eol/>occupied territory in violation of the Convention or this Protocol.</p>

          <p/>
          <p>3. Nothing in this Protocol shall be invoked for the purpose of affecting the sovereignty of a <eol/>State or the responsibility of the government, by all legitimate means, to maintain or re-<eol/>establish law and order in the State or to defend the national unity and territorial integrity of the <eol/>State.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>4. Nothing in this Protocol shall prejudice the primary jurisdiction of a Party in whose territory <eol/>an armed conflict not of an international character occurs over the violations set forth in Article <eol/>15.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>5. Nothing in this Protocol shall be invoked as a justification for intervening, directly or <eol/>indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the armed conflict or in the internal or external affairs of <eol/>the Party in the territory of which that conflict occurs.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>6. The application of this Protocol to the situation referred to in paragraph 1 shall not affect the <eol/>legal status of the parties to the conflict.</p>
          <p/>
          <p>7. UNESCO may offer its services to the parties to the conflict.</p>

                        <p eId="para_2">This is a simple and straightforward question which seeks to establish the funding situation of the Heritage Council.  I am particularly conscious of the fact that the Heritage Council, like all other State bodies, has understandably suffered significant cutbacks.  Will  the Minister of State give some sense of what is going to happen?</p>

                        <from>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht  (Deputy Heather Humphreys)</from>
                        <p eId="para_3">My Department is considering the funding available for the protection and conservation of the built heritage in 2016 in the context of its overall allocation and I will publish details of funding schemes for 2016 as soon as these are finalised.  Funding for the protection of built heritage will continue to be provided by my Department via a number of schemes which will be either directly administered or delivered through local authorities and agencies such as the Heritage Council.</p>
                        <p eId="para_4">As the Deputy can appreciate, the scope for funding for the conservation of the built heritage is constrained by the significant reduction in the public finances.  Nonetheless, I keep the competing priorities regarding the preservation and enhancement of the national heritage under ongoing review having regard to the resources available to my Department.  In this regard, my Department, in consultation with the Heritage Council, will be undertaking an expenditure review of the Heritage Council in early 2016 with a view to identifying any further improvements that might be achieved in the delivery of heritage services.</p>
                        <p eId="para_5">My Department's allocation to the Heritage Council in 2016 will be subject to the normal budgetary processes and final confirmation in the Revised Estimates.  It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports in 2016 and future years having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.</p>

                        <from>Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl</from>
                        <p eId="para_6">Has the Minister refused a request this year from the Heritage Council for a modest increase of €2.5 million in its budget?  The background to this debate is the meeting of the Oireachtas committee earlier this week in which we looked at the value for money report on the work of the Arts Council.  It is difficult to quantify and produce data in respect of the value of this work, even though it is clear there is value in it.  In the area of heritage, however, there are clear data available which suggest that public investment in the built heritage and in the works being undertaken by the Heritage Council delivers a dividend for the State.  The figures suggest that every €1 spent by the Department through the Heritage Council generates €4.40 in tourism revenue for the State.  When the Heritage Council looks for more money it is looking for further investment to generate product for the State.</p>

                        <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys</from>
                        <p eId="para_7">I acknowledge the work of the Heritage Council and the great work it does with communities.  In its pre-budget submission the council requested additional funding to invest in heritage-based initiatives, including an extended walled town network.  While this investment would be well spent, the reality is we are still living within constrained budgets and we have responsibility to manage the economy in a prudent fashion.  While I would love to be in a position to announce broad spending increases across all sections of my Department it would not be realistic, pragmatic or responsible.</p>
                        <p eId="para_8">I was pleased to announce a new built heritage investment scheme for the repair and conservation of protected structures, and this scheme is modelled on the built heritage jobs leverage scheme announced in 2013 which was very successfully piloted in 2014, resulting in the leveraging of almost €10 million in private sector investment and generating approximately 175 whole-time-equivalent jobs.</p>

                    <speech by="#SeanOFearghaillFF" eId="spk_5">
                        <from>Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl</from>
                        <p eId="para_9">We estimate that there are 25,000 jobs involved in the area of Ireland's historic environment and that €1.5 billion is being generated, so when we talk about investment in the Heritage Council, it is investment, not expenditure, and it more than pays for itself.  Is it true the Minister of State has refused the extra €2.5 million for which the Heritage Council asked?  Where stands does the action plan promised for historic properties?  Has it been published yet?  If it has not, when will it be published?  Is the Minister going to develop the heritage in schools programme into second level where there is obviously a need?  What more can she do to support the work of heritage officers?  In Kildare, for example, we have an outstanding heritage officer who does great work and one can see tangible benefits from what she does on the ground in the form of additional visits to Kildare.  I am sure it is the same in the Minister's county and in many others throughout country.  What will the Minister do to ensure there is additional spending which gives rise to revenue for the Exchequer?</p>

                        <p eId="para_10">I have announced an extra €2 million for heritage investment, similar to the jobs leverage programme in 2014.  This is direct investment in heritage which will be rolled out through local authorities and community groups, and individuals will have an opportunity to apply for funding.  It is a 50:50 project, so if someone comes up with 50% of the funding, the other 50% will be provided by the Department.  I agree with the Deputy that heritage is very important and I acknowledge the work of heritage officers on the ground who have done great work in mobilising communities.  We all know how many local heritage groups there are and how they work together to improve the heritage offering in all counties.  I am a member of a heritage group myself.</p>

                        <p eId="para_14">Ná bí buartha faoi sin, a Cheann Comhairle.  Mar is eol don Teachta, rinne mo Roinn athbhreithniú a choimisiúnú anuraidh ar an tseirbhís aeir i gcomhréir leis an Rialachán AE ábhartha.  Léirigh an t-athbhreithniú a rinne EY go raibh cás socheacnamaíoch ann don tseirbhís aeir.  Léiríodh fosta go raibh sé riachtanach sábháiltí a bhaint amach i gcomhthéacs an mhéadaithe de 136% a bhí tagtha ar chostas na seirbhíse aeir le linn na tréimhse athbhreithnithe deich mbliana a bhí faoi chaibidil sa tuarascáil.</p>
                        <p eId="para_15">Bunaithe ar mholtaí an athbhreithnithe agus tar éis dul i ndáil chomhairle le pobal Oileáin Árann, cuireadh próiseas tairisceana ar bun chun conradh a aontú don tseirbhís aeir don tréimhse ón 1 Deireadh Fómhair 2015 go dtí an 30 Meán Fómhair 2019.  Is í an Oifig um Sholáthar Rialtais a bhí i mbun an phróisis tairisceana a reáchtáil thar ceann mo Roinne i gcomhréir leis an Rialachán AE.  Ós rud é nach bhfuil sainmhíniú ná teorannú déanta ag an AE ar na cineálacha aerárthaí ar ar féidir bealaí faoi oibleagáid seirbhíse poiblí a thairiscint ina leith, ní fhéadfaí a leithéid a dhéanamh faoin bpróiseas tairisceana.</p>
                        <p eId="para_16">Ón uair gur bunaíodh an oibleagáid seirbhíse poiblí faoin Rialachán AE i 2001, bhí Aerfort na Gaillimhe agus Aerfort na Mine san áireamh i ngach aon phróiseas tairisceana don tseirbhís aeir.  Ciallaíonn an cur chuige seo go bhfuil an próiseas iomaíoch is leithne ann chun an luach is fearr ar airgead a fháil don Státchiste.</p>
                        <p eId="para_17">Tar éis measúnú a bheith déanta ar na hiarratais faoin bpróiseas tairisceana, fógraíodh an tairgeoir roghnaithe don chonradh seirbhíse aeir ar an 26 Lúnasa faoi réir chomhlíonadh tréimhse sosa deonaí de 14 lá.  Le linn an phróisis tairisceana, tháinig sé chun solais go raibh éiginnteacht ag baint le hAerfort na Gaillimhe a bheith ar fáil don tairgeoir roghnaithe don tréimhse iomlán ceithre bliana den chonradh a bhí beartaithe.  Tar éis do mo Roinn soiléiriú a fháil maidir leis seo, tógadh an cinneadh go raibh údair oibiachtúla ann chun deireadh a chur leis an bpróiseas tairisceana.  Cuireadh an cinneadh sin in iúl do na tairgeoirí agus chuaigh mo Roinn i mbun idirbheartaíochta leis an soláthróir reatha chun conradh eatramhach bliana a aontú go 30 Meán Fómhair 2016.</p>
                        <p eId="para_18">Le linn na tréimhse atá amach romhainn, beidh mo Roinn, i gcomhar leis an Oifig um Sholáthar Rialtais, ag tabhairt faoi phróiseas tairisceana úr chun conradh ceithre bliana a aontú don tréimhse ó 1 Deireadh Fómhair 2016.  Déanfar é seo i gcomhréir leis na riachtanais dhlíthiúla faoi na rialacha náisiúnta soláthair agus an Rialachán AE ábhartha.</p>

An bhfuil an Oifig um Sholáthar Rialtais ag plé leis an gceist seo arís?  Má tá, an bhfuil critéir nua leagtha amach fá choinne an PSO ar feadh na ceithre bliana sin?  An féidir leis an Aire Stáit iad san a fhoilsiú?  An gcinnteoidh na critéir seo gur seirbhís as Aerfort Chonamara a bheidh ann san tairiscint úr?

Níl mé in ann freagra a thabhairt ar na ceisteanna maidir leis an gcineál tairiscintí a bheidh ar fáil nó an sciatháin dhobhogtha a bheidh ann.  An príomhrud anois ná an comhrá le muintir Árann.  Tá stair mór ann ó thaobh na ceiste seo agus eolas againn as sin.  Tá súil agam go gcoimeádfaidh na cinnirí ar Oileáin Árann leis an obair atá ar siúl acu ar son mhuintir Árann.  Bhí daoine faoi bhrú san am atá imithe tharainn.  B'fhéidir gurb é an rud is tábhachtaí amach anseo ná an comhrá agus an díospóireacht idir na geallshealbhóirí.</p>

Ní raibh mé in ann aon fhocal a rá faoi ag an am toisc gurbh próiseas neamhspleách a bhí i gceist.  Bhí ról ag an Oifig um Sholáthair Rialtais i 2014.  Sin an próiseas úr maidir le seo.  Ní raibh aon difríocht ar bith ann idir an próiseas i 2001 nuair a bhí Aerfort na Minne agus Aerfort na Gaillimhe clúdaithe sna tairiscintí agus ag achan am ina dhiaidh sin.

                        <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys</from>
                        <p eId="para_25">My predecessor, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, placed a preservation order under the National Monuments Acts on Nos. 14-17 Moore Street on the premise that No. 16 was the final headquarters of the 1916 Rising and the location of the last council of war by the 1916 leaders when the decision to surrender was taken.  Nos. 14, 15 and 17 Moore Street were included in the preservation order to enhance and preserve the amenity and setting of No. 16.  Collectively, the four buildings represent the most significant, original, complete, discrete and continuous section of substantially intact pre-1916 buildings on the street, with most of the remaining buildings dating from after 1916.</p>
                        <p eId="para_26">While No. 10 Moore Street was the first building broken into by the insurgents, the building is now separated from the national monument by new buildings since built on the sites of Nos. 11, 12 and 13 and is, therefore, isolated from its context.  Moreover, the facade of No. 10 has undergone significant interventions in the meantime which have compromised the architectural and historical integrity of the structure.</p>
                        <p eId="para_27">Outside of Nos. 14-17 Moore Street, the remaining parts of the terrace fail to meet the criteria of a national monument under the National Monuments Acts.  Following my announcement earlier this week of the purchase of Nos. 14-17 Moore Street by the State and of the conservation and restoration now under way, I am satisfied that coupled with the new visitor centre being developed in the GPO, the Moore Street commemorative centre will be a fitting and lasting tribute to the 1916 Easter Rising.</p>

                        <p eId="para_28">I thank the Minister for her reply.  I do not know if the Minister did a tour with the relatives group from the GPO all the way around to the point of the surrender.  Each relative tells the story of their particular relative, whether it was Thomas MacDonagh, Joseph Plunkett, The O'Rahilly or James Connolly.  It is an area that is steeped in history.  Is there a concern that because of the lack of an independent survey and an assessment by suitably qualified persons, we could end up losing many other buildings of historic significance, not just No. 10 but O'Brien's mineral water building, the White House, Cogans, Hanlons and so on?  The Minister must be aware of the passion of the relatives and their supporters who have a different vision for the restoration of the area.  What do we want there?  While a national monument at Nos. 14-17 Moore Street is welcome, we have to look at Nos. 14-17 Moore Street in the context of the wider area.  I emphasise the need to be perfectly sure we are preserving the area that should be preserved because we will not get another chance.</p>

                        <p eId="para_29">I am satisfied we are preserving what is the national monument at Nos. 14-17 Moore Street.  As the Deputy is aware, work has started on that site and it will be a lasting tribute to the memory of the rebels in the 1916 Rising.  On the issue of the relatives, I am aware how passionate they are about this.  We have been working with the relatives and have had numerous meetings with them.  I have visited the site and have been around all the areas.  I have visited Nos. 14, 15, 16 and 17 Moore Street and it is obvious they are substantially intact as per pre-1916 buildings.  It is clear that many of the other buildings have been knocked down and rebuilt which is the case with those on either side.  In regard to No. 10, independent reports were prepared for my Department by Shaffrey Associates architects and Frank Myles archaeologists in February 2012 as part of the examination of the proposed restoration project under the National Monuments Acts.  These are eminent people in the archaeological, architectural and historical fields and my Department is satisfied with the quality of their research.</p>

                        <p eId="para_32">I acknowledge the group of supporters who are there every Saturday gathering thousands of petitions to save the whole area and the whole terrace.  The Taoiseach referred to the laneways around there as the laneways of history.  They are in danger of also being destroyed under this plan.  One has to question the practicality and suitability of the current plan which is for a massive shopping centre which will dominate the area and is totally unsuitable alongside Nos. 14-17 Moore Street as the national monument.  It will also threaten the street trading tradition that has been going on there for centuries.  I ask the Minister to use her powers under the National Monuments Acts to save those laneways and remove them from the planning application in the way that Nos. 14-17 Moore Street were removed.  We are missing an opportunity to develop the area in an innovative way that will preserve and respect its historical and cultural significance.  Do we need another shopping centre there?  Clerys has closed and Boyers is about to close.  Is our vision for that street another shopping centre?</p>

                        <p eId="para_33">The decision to add structures to the record of protected structures is a matter for the local authority, in this case Dublin City Council.  My responsibility is for Nos. 14-17 Moore Street, the national monument.  We have been speaking to the traders.  I have been down there and have met them and consulted them.  They are very happy with the proposed development for Moore Street in terms of Nos. 14-17 and they are onside.  They want to ensure they can continue to trade during this work.  To be fair to the traders, when the work on Nos. 14-17 is completed as a new centre, it will allow people doing the tour in the GPO - 300,000 visitors are expected - to go through the route to the national monument which will be the 1916 Easter Rising centre.  The development will upgrade the street.  Having been down there two days it certainly needs a facelift.  The development of Nos. 14-17 Moore Street would be a major boost for that area.</p>

                        <p eId="para_46">The Government decided to acquire the national monument at Nos. 14–17 Moore Street because of its historical association with the events of Easter 1916.  This decision demonstrates and acknowledges the historical importance of the site in a clear and substantive way and ensures that the long-term future of this historic landmark will be preserved and safeguarded.  Bringing the monument into public ownership will also allow the development of a 1916 commemorative centre on the site.</p>
                        <p eId="para_47">The legal steps to bring the national monument into the ownership of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht have been completed.  The purchase from the previous owner was effected with the assistance of NAMA and the consideration of €4 million was arrived at in the normal commercial manner.</p>
                        <p eId="para_48">I am now pressing ahead as a priority with arrangements to implement the Government's decision in full.  My Department concluded a tendering process for the scheme of conservation works initiated when the property was under lien by NAMA in order to get construction work under way as speedily as possible to prevent further deterioration of the fabric of the national monument buildings.  This conservation work has now commenced and will be completed during the 2016 centenary year.  Provision has been made to facilitate managed public access to the monument for some centenary events.</p>
                        <p eId="para_49">The work will be ongoing but we will try to allow some people in during the centenary events around Easter.  The work will be painstaking and careful because most of it will involve restoration to bring the site back to its condition in 1916.</p>

The Minister and I have been in these buildings so we are aware of the state of them.  On the tendering process, were there other tenders?  Where did the figure of €5 million come from?</p>
                        <p eId="para_51">Was an approach made to Chartered Land, appealing to its sense of culture or history, if it has one, to take a more innovative approach to the area and to consider having more small business there, which would be in keeping with the historical area, so that it would be a living street?  People lived there for hundreds of years, and there is also the street trading tradition.  Such an approach would make the street a vibrant, living street again.</p>
                        <p eId="para_52">Regarding the monument, is the Minister sure that it will be curated, restored and preserved in accordance with best international practice?</p>

                        <p eId="para_53">On the last question, I am certain that it will be done according to best international practice.  A steering committee is being established to oversee the project.  It will include officials from my Department, the National Monuments Service, the Office of Public Works, the OPW, the National Archives, the National Museum and Dublin City Council.  I am very satisfied that the steering committee has a lot of expertise and a huge amount of interest in this building.  On Tuesday, Catriona Crowe from the National Archives and Lar Joye from the National Museum were in the building with me as I went through it again.  It is important that it is done carefully and that it is restored to its 1916 condition.  Deputy O'Sullivan has been there.  There are holes in the wall and one can see where the tunnel was broken through.  It is important that that is illustrated properly and that the bricks that were put in are taken out carefully.  There is a lot of work to be done but I have no doubt that everyone will be working together to make sure it is done to the proper standard.</p>

                        <p eId="para_54">The Minister seems to be adopting the Chartered Land ministerial order that was obtained under a planning application and which would also demolish the whole area around Nos. 14-17 Moore Street.  It is important that what goes around the national monument is appropriate to it.  I still do not understand why the Government had to buy back the national monument, which, as we know, was a derelict site.</p>
                        <p eId="para_55">Have there been any sanctions or fines for Chartered Land?  It held Nos. 14-17 Moore Street for a number of years.  Has it been fined for the way in which it allowed it to become so derelict?  There were problems with the roof and the local authority had to step in at times.  Chartered Land seems to have gotten away with anything it wanted to do there.  It will demolish everything around it.  It allowed a national monument to fall into disrepair and dereliction, yet there was no fine or sanction against it.</p>

                        <p eId="para_56">The €4 million figure has been in the public realm since 31 March 2015 when I announced the Government decision to acquire the national monument.  This figure was arrived at in the usual commercial manner.  The Deputy will recall that before the Government stepped in, Dublin City Council had turned down a deal involving the acquisition of the Moore Street national monument in part exchange for Nos. 24 and 25.  As part of that proposed transaction, there was a €4 million price tag on Nos. 14-17 Moore Street.  The €4 million was agreed upon by NAMA in the normal commercial manner.  The wider transaction was rejected by the council, so the Government stepped in to save the national monument.  There was a serious risk to the fabric of the buildings from continued non-intervention.  Given the Government's commitment to safeguarding the site and making it publicly accessible during the centenary year, it was much better to move in, and we are using the existing planning application.  Time is not on our side and the building is deteriorating all the time.  We are using the existing planning permission and we can start now.  Most of the works will be restoration work.  Because of the particular circumstances of the project, involving historically unique and sensitive buildings, and the imminence of the 2016 centenary, I believe that this approach represents the most practical means of delivering a 2016 commemorative centre.</p>

                        <p eId="para_58">I would welcome an update on the consultation process for Culture 2025.  This is a very important undertaking and body of work.  It is very timely.  We are all aware of our economic woes but, ironically, it is at times when people are under pressure that we can focus most on what is important about our culture and not only on the superficial.  Our society is multicultural.  Sometimes people can feel threatened by other cultures, so it is very important to underpin our culture and embrace other people in a spirit of inclusiveness.  It is important for the reinforcement of identity, both historically and in a contemporary sense, for creative industries and because of its potential for tourism.  I welcome the Minister's undertaking.</p>

                        <p eId="para_59">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I congratulate the author Kevin Barry on winning the Goldsmiths Prize for literature for his new novel,<i>Beatlebone</i>.  This follows his IMPAC award for <i>City of Bohane.</i>  Kevin is truly one of our great contemporary writers and I am delighted for him.</p>
                        <p eId="para_60">At a meeting on 20 June 2014, the Government approved the drafting of a national cultural policy, Culture 2025, which will set out the high-level aims and policies of the Government in this area in the period up to 2025.  The broad aim of Culture 2025 will be to reinforce the crucial role of culture in society by supporting the cultural sector and providing conditions that will allow the sector to develop and flourish across all areas of society.  Culture 2025 will seek to reflect the modern multicultural Ireland and will be uplifting, accessible, relevant and easy to communicate.  To facilitate public consultation on the proposed policy, my Department published a discussion document on 8 August 2015.  It followed this up by holding a series of local workshops to enable people across the country to have their views heard.  Meetings took place in Cavan, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Kilkenny and Dublin.  The Dublin event followed the participative world café model and was held under the open public debates programme.  More than 600 people have attended the consultation events, and more than 200 written submissions have been received.  The closing date for receipt of submissions was 31 October 2015.  My Department also established both an expert group and a steering group made up of cultural stakeholders who are having an input into the consultation and drafting process.  The feedback from the regional meetings and the submissions received will now be examined in detail as part of the process of drafting the cultural policy.  I intend that this will be a high-level and living document to set out the framework of cultural policy for the next decade.  I will submit the policy document to Government in due course, with the intention of publishing it early in 2016.</p>

                        <p eId="para_61">I am delighted to hear the progress that has been made.  I like the description of it as a living document, because our culture is living.   One issue that is of interest and that is very exciting for many of us in rural areas is our built cultural heritage, which we can still see much of.  Moore Street and Dublin have been discussed, but there are many early Christian heritage buildings in Mayo.  I would like the document to include cultural heritage hubs, in which we can look at our culture not only historically but in a contemporary fashion, perhaps through the arts.  In Mayo, there is a tradition of French Mayo, which commemorates the 1798 landings.  There is a lot of history around that.  In my town, we are developing a Mary Robinson centre to look at contemporary issues worldwide.  We also have the Jackie Clarke library, and I feel this would dovetail very well with Culture 2025.  Strategic planning around the empowerment of cultural hubs should be part of the plan for supporting our culture in the future.</p>

                        <p eId="para_62">Our cultural policy will encompass both our built and natural heritage, because it is all part of what we are.  We can look at cultural hubs because it is something that will probably come through the consultation process.  I have not had an opportunity yet to look at all the submissions as the process finished at the end of October 2015.  It has been a very open process and we have gone right around the country to the different centres I mentioned and have asked their views.  I am interested in how we protect and enrich our culture and how we embrace technology, because it will have an impact upon our culture.  We need to look at all those areas and be ready and have this policy in place.  This is the first time I have ever had a cultural policy, and I want to set high-level aims to protect and enrich our culture and to embrace other cultures.  That is very important, because the coming of other cultures helps us to enrich our own culture.</p>

                        <p eId="para_63">The idea of the hub is that even though we all share similarities in terms of our traditions, culture and background, there are unique defining histories in different parts of the country, for example, the 1798 landings in Mayo.  The more we focus on that, and give a depth and a study to it, the more we make it interesting for tourists, and it also reinforces our own sense of identity or pride of place.  That is the attraction we have, and the more exploration and supports we have for that, the more interface there will be.  We have many experts who know a lot about these things.  It is a question of making the information, the knowledge and the appreciation of it more readily available to ourselves and to tourists.  This would reinforce our tourism industry going forward as well as safeguarding our cultural heritage.</p>

                        <p eId="para_64">It is something we can look at.  A cultural hub relates to a specific area.  The Deputy is moving into the area of tourism, where we have the Wild Atlantic Way and now Ireland's Ancient East.  Perhaps we can have something along those lines, given that different areas have unique connections to culture that other areas do not have.  We can certainly look at it.</p>

                        <p eId="para_66">I thank the Minister for her statement this morning.  I want her to know how excited people living in Inchicore and the wider area are that Richmond Barracks has been picked as one of the main projects in the national programme for 1916.  I want to highlight the belief people have that this will become a huge part of the cultural events in the area around Kilmainham Gaol, the courthouse and the wider area in general.</p>

                        <p eId="para_67">I thank the Deputy for raising the issue again.  The Government is supporting eight flagship capital projects for the 1916 centenary year.  These will create a lasting legacy of 1916 and will be of huge interest to members of the public.  Dublin City Council is overseeing the Richmond Barracks project. It is anticipated that a six-month programme of works will lead to completion of the project in April 2016.  The project will see the restoration of specific parts of Richmond Barracks, particularly the building where the 1916 leaders were interned and court-martialled, and the creation of an exhibition and interpretive space and will be a great amenity for the public and for the local community.  The contract for the interpretive element has been placed and works are all on schedule for official opening on 2 May 2016.  Richmond Barracks is also working with the cemeteries commission to reopen Goldenbridge cemetery and to create a walkway linked with Richmond Barracks.</p>
                        <p eId="para_68">Kilmainham Gaol is a national monument site in the care of the Office of Public Works and is one of the most popular and heavily visited tourist sites in Ireland.  The work on the courthouse is on schedule for completion early in 2016 and it is expected that the building will be opened formally on 30 March.  This project will provide an enriched visitor experience and enhanced display of many original artefacts.</p>

                        <p eId="para_69">I thank the Minister.  Work has begun and, just last week, we had an extraordinary day in which people were invited to come to the parish hall with memorabilia to help identify people who had lived in the area when it was Richmond Barracks, Keogh Square and St. Michael's estate.  Things are starting to move very fast.  Although it probably does not concern her Department directly, I ask the Minister to consider the needs of the whole precinct outside Richmond Barracks, particularly the streetscape, footpaths and lighting.  It would be good if something could be done through the Government to enhance these, given that we expect thousands of visitors next year.  Given that so much dedication, time, effort and funding has been put into Richmond Barracks, for the opening day there should be a proper streetscape, lighting and footpaths in the precinct to enhance the area even more.</p>
                        <p eId="para_70">I want to stress how important this project is for people living in the Inchicore area and the wider community.  We are grateful it was chosen as one of the main flagship projects for 1916.  I want to extend my thanks to the Minister, to whom we have spoken on numerous occasions when she has visited the site, the graveyard and the courthouse.  I want to extend to her the appreciation of all in the area.</p>

                        <p eId="para_71">To be fair, this is a great project with three different stakeholders: the community, Dublin City council and the Government.  Great work has been done by the community and the committee, of which Deputy Byrne and other Deputies are members.  That great community engagement and buy-in is what makes this project so successful.  I was at the opening day, which was a powerful event.  What is important about Richmond Barracks is that there are two sides to its history, in that the 1916 leaders were brought there for court-martial while, at the same time, young Irishmen were enlisting to fight in the First World War.  It brings it all together and, as we go through the decade of centenaries, it shows how one event impacted on the other, given that they were both in the one building at the one time.</p>
                        <p eId="para_72">It is a great project.  I take the Deputy's point about the streetscape and lighting.  There is a steering committee in place and when Dublin City Council, the Department and the committee meet again, this is an issue that can be discussed.  All in all, it is a good news story, and the better news is that it will be finished on time.</p>

Muna bhfuil an t-eolas sin ag an Aire Stáit, tá sé sin ceart go leor.  Is féidir leis é sin a rá.  An féidir leis an t-eolas sin a thabhairt chugam, áfach?  Sin páirt den cheist a cuireadh ar an Aire Stáit mar is é an tAire atá freagrach as an nGaeltacht.  Cé go bhfuil an t-airgead ag teacht ó Roinn eile, níl dabht ar bith ann, agus aithníonn an tAire Stáit é seo, ach go bhfuil seisean freagrach as fosta ó thaobh infreastruchtúr cheantair Gaeltachta.  Bhí na pobail seo i dteagmháil leis an Aire Stáit faoin gceist seo.  Is ceist fíor-thábhachtach í ó thaobh sábháilteacht an phobail sin agus go háirithe sábháilteacht an lucht iascaire.</p>

An rud is tábhachtaí anois ná an comhrá idir mhuintir Árann agus na comhairlí i nGaillimh maidir leis an mbealach is fearr tabhairt faoin obair seo.  Tá coiste oileán faoi scáth an chomhairle contae i nDún na nGall agus tá sé iontach tábhachtach ó thaobh an cheangail idir daoine ar an mórthír agus ar na hoileáin agus an comhairle contae.  Tá mé ag iarraidh comhrá agus díospóireacht idir coiste agus na comhairlí i nGaillimh.  Chomh maith le san, tá dualgas ar an Roinn Comhshaoil, Pobail agus Rialtais Áitiúil maidir leis an airgead.  Thug an Roinn sin gealltanas ina chlár caipitil.  Tá an gealltanas san ann ach ní bheidh mise ar an eolas maidir leis an uair a thosófar leis an obair.  Tá comhrá de dhíth idir mhuintir Inis Oírr agus mé féin.  Fanfaimid i dteagmháil leis na daoine sin amach anseo fosta.</p>

                        <p eId="para_99">I was worried for a moment that we would not have time to talk about Bambi.  To be serious, however, this is an important question because a number of serious traffic accidents involving deer have occurred in the Killarney area.  The response of the Department has been to authorise the National Parks and Wildlife Service to undertake a cull of red deer in Killarney National Park.  This is an issue of concern to many people.</p>
                    </speech>
                    <speech by="#HeatherHumphreys" eId="spk_64">
                        <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys</from>
                        <p eId="para_100">I thank Deputy Ó Fearghaíl for raising this matter.  With regard to Killarney National Park, every year, as part of the ongoing management of deer populations within the park, deer numbers need to be reduced.  It is intended to commence culling later this month once the rut has finished.  This work will be undertaken by qualified and competent National Parks and Wildlife Service personnel of my Department.  The proposed cull is no different from what has happened in previous years.</p>
                        <p eId="para_101">I recognise that the red deer of Killarney National Park and the surrounding area are of national conservation significance and that the subject of culling is emotive.  There is a significant challenge in attempting to balance the demands of agriculture, forestry and conservation with the need to ensure that deer populations occupying the same land resources are managed at sustainable levels and in a responsible and ethical manner.  My Department routinely carries out localised deer counts on State lands such as in Wicklow and Killarney national parks.  I am aware that deer species are increasing in range and numbers.  Where appropriate and depending on the count and instances of damage caused by deer to habitats, especially woodland, culls need to be carried out to ensure deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences.</p>
                        <p eId="para_102">Park rangers, during their normal daily duties, often take spot counts of deer on the lowlands.  Sika deer numbers are not out of control in Killarney National Park and are at much lower densities than can be found in Wicklow National Park.  However, the National Parks and Wildlife Service would like to further reduce the numbers of this non-native species.  While red deer numbers have not significantly increased in the uplands of the park, lowland numbers have increased and these deer are highly visible.  Unfortunately, given that deer cannot be herded like domestic animals, it is not possible to relocate them from the lowlands to the uplands.</p>
                    </speech>
                    <speech by="#SeanOFearghaillFF" eId="spk_65">
                        <from>Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl</from>
                        <p eId="para_103">I am a little confused by the Minister's reference to a count as I understood the Department had indicated that it did not have sufficient resources to conduct a count.  If that is the case, it would bother me as the number of red deer in Killarney National Park is not especially significant.  It probably stands at between 500 and 700 and, as such, one would expect the Department to have sufficient resources to count them.</p>
                        <p eId="para_104">The Minister's party colleague, Senator Paul Coghlan, has expressed concern about the culling of red deer, while others have argued that any such cull would be blind if the National Parks and Wildlife Service was not aware of the numbers involved.  We need to consider the history of the red deer, which stretches back nearly 10,000 years before Christ to the Ice Age.  As the only native and indigenous deer, there is an understandable public reaction to the possibility of some red deer being culled.  Will the Minister explain the position regarding the count and respond to Senator Paul Coghlan's comment that the cull should target the non-indigneous sika deer rather than the native Irish red deer?</p>
                    </speech>
                    <speech by="#HeatherHumphreys" eId="spk_66">
                        <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys</from>
                        <p eId="para_105">The cull is part of the ongoing management of deer populations in Killarney National Park and deer numbers may need to be reduced every year.  The proposed cull is no different from what has taken place in previous years.  Sika deer numbers in the park are not out of control and are at much lower densities than can be found Wicklow National Park.  As I stated, the National Parks and Wildlife Service would like to further reduce deer numbers because lowland numbers have increased and the deer have become highly visible.</p>
                        <p eId="para_106">On the ongoing management of the deer population, the intention of any cull would be to focus on the red deer populations in Muckross and Knockreer in the first instance.  I will clarify the details of the spot counts carried out by park rangers for the Deputy at a later stage if he does not mind.</p>
                        <p eId="para_107">A number of experts have concluded that a cull is required.  Research completed and published in 2012 by Dr. Ruth Carden, an associate of the National Museum of Ireland and the Wild Deer Association of Ireland, highlighted that the native County Kerry red deer herd suffered from low genetic diversity.  Dr. Carden outlined in the findings of a four-year research programme by scientists that the herd at Killarney National Park needed to number between 600 and 1,000 animals to be sustainable; otherwise, its health would be at risk from disease and weakening associated with in-breeding.  According to a recent statement from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the service estimates the number of red deer in Killarney National Park to be approximately 500.  Culls of older red deer are carried out to improve the herd.  That is the current position.</p>

                    <speech by="#SeanOFearghaillFF" eId="spk_67">
                        <from>Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl</from>
                        <p eId="para_108">It is a good thing that those types of culls are not carried out in politics.  One wonders why it is not possible to relocate some of the red deer in Killarney National Park to other State lands.  The Minister and I both come from an agricultural background and appreciate the importance of proper husbandry and management of stock.  It has always struck me as particularly sad when visiting the Phoenix Park, for example, that the deer one sees in the park are not indigenous red deer.  What would prevent the Department from relocating red deer from Killarney and, in so doing, hopefully improve the health status of the deer?</p>

                        <p eId="para_110">As the Deputy noted, Senator Paul Coghlan raised the issue of deer causing traffic accidents on roads in Killarney.  I will raise these issues with officials and revert to the Deputy.</p>

                    <p eId="para_115">I understand the Deputy had concluded his contribution when the debate adjourned yesterday evening.  If I may, I will respond to the amendment, on which Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace, who are present, also made contributions.</p>
                    <p eId="para_116">Deputies Daly and Wallace raised concerns about the grouping of amendments.  I do not propose to restate what I said yesterday, other than that to point out that groupings are a matter for the Bills Office.  The group we are discussing consists of amendments Nos. 3 to 6, inclusive, 81 to 86, inclusive, and 88 and 102, in the names of Deputies Wallace, Clare Daly and Mac Lochlainn.</p>
                    <p eId="para_117">The role of the policing authority will be to oversee the performance by An Garda Síochána of its policing services functions.  The amendments in the names of Deputies Daly and Wallace would assign to GSOC the functions of the Government in relation to national security.  Deputies will be aware that the core function of GSOC is to investigate complaints made against members of An Garda Síochána and that it has no oversight function in relation to national security.  Indeed, there is a general consensus in the House that the authority should not have such a function in any event.  The amendments would give rise to an unusual set of reporting arrangements whereby the Garda Commissioner would, among other things, account fully to GSOC in relation to security services through the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality.  It is difficult to understand how this would work in practice.</p>
                    <p eId="para_118">Deputy Mac Lochlainn's amendments would have the effect of removing the role of the Minister in determining whether a matter relates to State security.  The Minister has carefully considered the amendments and, given that the security of the State is a priority function of the Government, is of the view that the task of deciding whether a matter relates to policing or security should be undertaken by the Minister of the day in his or her capacity as a member of the Government.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn disagreed yesterday, but that is the view of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  Before making any decision as to whether a matter involves policing or security, a Minister will be required to act impartially.  I understand that the approach adopted in the Bill is in line with similar arrangements in Northern Ireland in relation to security matters.  For example, the Chief Constable may refer to the Secretary of State a requirement to submit a report to the Northern Ireland Policing Board if it appears to the Chief Constable that a report in compliance with the requirement would contain information which ought not to be disclosed in the interests of national security.  The Secretary of State may then modify or, in fact, set aside the requirement.  The Minister believes the arrangements proposed in the Bill are appropriate and she asks the Deputies not to press the amendments.</p>

                    <from>Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn</from>
                    <p eId="para_119">An Garda Síochána is perhaps unique.  I am not sure if it is the only one, but it is one of the few police services in the world that retains security and policing responsibilities.  To compare it with the North is not to make an exact comparison.  There are a number of intelligence agencies, including MI5 and MI6, that operate internally and externally from Whitehall and on the banks of the Thames.  One of our concerns in this State has been to separate politics from policing as much as we can.  We want the police to become a police service with genuinely independent oversight rather than a police force.  We want an independent member of the Judiciary who can look at the definition of "security" in the Act, which at least is there and as such is welcome albeit we have some disagreements on it, and adjudicate as recommended by the Chief Justice.  This is not a Sinn Féin proposal.  It was Mr. Conor Brady who planted the seed for me.  It is an eminently sensible proposal and a good and acceptable solution.  Nobody would challenge the independence of a judge and, on most occasions, my guess is that the independent member of the Judiciary would agree with An Garda Síochána's assessment.  That is my guess and, as such, I do not see the problem.</p>
                    <p eId="para_120">Historically, the Department of Justice and Equality has failed, as proven in the recent report, substantially in its oversight role.  Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister and the Department have failed to fulfil the responsibilities of their oversight of An Garda Síochána, they wish to retain that function.  I am disappointed that the Minister was there that day in the company of Mr. Conor Brady and Dr. Vicky Conway, two people who are very respected for their analysis of the changes required, but takes this view.  While the Garda Commissioner gave an impressive presentation yesterday, that presentation is undermined by the politicians and departmental officials who insist on retaining control.  I do not see any viable reason for the Government to refuse to accept the amendment which is based on an idea put forward by Conor Brady.  Everyone in the room thought it was a good idea, including the Law Society, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and even the Minister.  Obviously, someone in the Department got in her ear and said "You don't want to let this happen".  That is not the change we need.</p>

                    <p eId="para_121">I find it a bit confusing that amendment No. 102 has been grouped with these amendments.  Amendment No. 102 comes under Part 5 of the Bill on accountability.  In amendment No. 102, we propose that the Garda Commissioner shall account fully to the authority through the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality on any aspect of his or her relevant functions relating to policing issues and account fully to GSOC in relation to security issues.  As a result of the manner in which the amendments have been grouped, we are pushed for speaking time on the different elements.</p>
                    <p eId="para_122">Our policing Bill, introduced two years ago and again last year, proposed to amend section 40 to make the Commissioner accountable to the board and the Government through the Minister.  Our Bill sought to delete the provision in section 40(2) which places a duty on the Garda Commissioner to provide any document in the power or possession of An Garda Síochána on request by the Secretary General, including witness statements and Garda records.  Our Bill sought to narrow the duty of the Commissioner to keep the Minister informed under section 41 by removing (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) and leaving only a duty in relation to peace and public order, protection of life and property and security of the State and by creating a duty to keep the board fully informed of any significant development which might reasonably be expected to affect public confidence in the Garda and any other matters that should be brought to the attention of the board.  We also sought to amend section 41 to allow both the board and the Minister to request a report from the Garda Commissioner and section 42 to give both the board and the Minister the power to initiate a special inquiry.</p>

                <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_75">
                    <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
                    <p eId="para_123">It is ironic that the Minister of State refers to our amendments as confusing when one of the key problems with the Government's Bill is that it itself is confusing.  The Bill envisages a model where there is an equal division of accountability between the security and policing work of An Garda Síochána.  Accountability is directly to the Minister in relation to security while in relation to policing, An Garda Síochána is sometimes accountable to the Minister, sometimes to the authority, sometimes to both and sometimes to the authority which is thereafter accountable to the Minister.  One of our key points is that this confused model will not work and will result in future blame games similar to the ones which arose around the GSOC controversy.</p>
                    <p eId="para_124">There is nothing wrong with our proposal to give GSOC a role in deciding these matters.  There is no unified body that says it should not have that type of input.  The IHREC, the Government's own statutory body on human rights, has specifically expressed the view that there is no difficulty with issues of national security policing being examined by GSOC or overseen by the authority itself where national security policing impacts on the fundamental rights of individuals.  We made the point last night that the authority could also have a liaison role with any Oireachtas committee which has competence for national security policing review as per the IHREC recommendation.</p>
                    <p eId="para_125">The IHREC has stated that it is a requirement of the European Court of Human Rights that we have an independent body to consider this matter, but we will still not have one at the end of this process.  The purpose of our amendments is to make improvements in this regard, but that is difficult when they are grouped together despite being nuanced and relating to various aspects of the Bill.</p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#DaraMurphy" eId="spk_76" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice_and_Equality">
                    <from>Deputy Dara Murphy</from>
                    <p eId="para_126">Given the trooping up and down the country trying to frighten the people of rural Ireland about policing levels, it has been disappointing to sit through this debate for more than an hour last night and again today with no member of Fianna Fáil present.  It is the party that closed the academy at Templemore and reduced Garda numbers.  Since this is a serious issue, it is disappointing that there has been no representation from the largest Opposition party for such a prolonged period.  It seems to be keeping its commentary for the public airwaves and public meetings instead of engaging in the Chamber today.</p>
                    <p eId="para_127">I have outlined the rationale for the non-acceptance of the Deputies' amendments.  To be of further assistance, I will draw their attention to provisions in the Bill that are designed to promote a culture of co-operation and respect between the authority and the Garda, thereby minimising some of the Deputies' concerns about the potential for disagreement.</p>
                    <p eId="para_128">Section 24 amends the current functions of the Garda Commissioner to place an obligation on her or him to assist and co-operate with the authority in order to facilitate the performance of its functions under the Bill.  Section 44 inserts a new section 62I into the principal Act that places an obligation on the authority to have regard to the importance of the Garda's functions concerning security services.  Regarding the Deputies' comments about clarity in the definition of "security services", the expectation is that the likelihood of any dispute between the parties as to whether a matter is one of security will be minimal.</p>
                    <p eId="para_129">Notwithstanding the scale of the UK, there are examples in Northern Ireland and Scotland of matters being referred to the State Secretary and the Minister, respectively, where there are disagreements between police forces and their oversight bodies.</p>
                    <p eId="para_130">We must not lose sight of the fact that the role envisaged for the Minister will preserve her accountability for policing matters to this House.  Deputies referenced the engagement between the Minister and her Department.  She fully supports all of the amendments-----</p>

                    <p eId="para_135">The Minister of State cannot ignore the fact that many of the experts are not impressed with what could have been something good.  I have gone through a number of the provisions that were in our Bills last year and the year before.  These amendments are a serious watering down of those.  We did not just invent them.  We consulted everyone, anyone and anything involved in policing in Ireland and abroad.</p>
                    <p eId="para_136">The Minister of State pointed out a number of changes that he viewed as positive.  I will mainly discuss section 5 on accountability, which encompasses our amendment and amendment No. 102, but there is no change to section 40:</p>
                    <p class="indent_1" eId="para_137">... which sets out that the Garda Commissioner shall account fully to the Government and Minister through the Secretary General for any aspect of his or her functions, including the duty to provide any document.  Clearly, the Commissioner remains accountable to the Minister and Government only.  The new Bill just adds a section setting out that the Commissioner shall report to the authority with regard to policing services to facilitate the performance by the authority of its functions under this Act and extends the duty of [the] Commissioner to provide documents to the authority also.  The wide breadth of communication between Minister and Commissioner remains under section 41 and a clause is added to set out that if and in so far as a report by the Commissioner to the Minister relates to policing services, the Minister shall inform the authority of those matters.  The Minister does not even have to provide the authority with a copy of the report.  Furthermore, there is no comparable duty on the Commissioner inserted to keep the authority informed on significant developments relating to policing, for example, peace and public order, but only to keep the authority informed of matters relevant to the authority's functions.</p>
                    <p eId="para_138">The authority may request a report from the Commissioner on policing and may publish all or part of it.</p>
                    <p eId="para_139">Section 42 remains the same, in that only the Minister can appoint a person to set up a special inquiry, for example, Ms Emily Logan in the case of the Roma children, but the Minister must consult the authority first.  The authority can request that a special inquiry be set up, but the Minister can refuse.  Even if she accedes to the authority's request, the report of that inquiry goes to her and not the authority.  The Minister sets the inquiry's terms of reference and, if it relates to policing services, has a duty to consult the authority.  Furthermore, section 42 has been amended to allow whoever is conducting the inquiry to question members of the authority as well as the Garda during the course of the inquiry.</p>
                    <p eId="para_140">The new Bill amends section 44 to provide that the audit committee is appointed by the authority and is to provide copies of its report to the Minister and the authority.  Section 46 of the original Act is amended so that the annual policing report will be submitted by the Commissioner to the authority, not the Minister, and that the authority shall supply a copy of that report to the Minister.  In November, the heads of the Bill proposed that section 40 be amended to make the Garda Commissioner fully accountable to the authority for policing matters and to the Government for security matters, but the legislation as published does not follow through on this.  The Commissioner remains accountable to the Government only, just as it was under the 2005 Act, with an added lesser duty on the Commissioner to report to the authority in order for it to fulfil its functions under the Bill.  This is a major disappointment.  The Minister of State can claim that the Government received legal advice on this, that or the other and that there may be constitutional problems but, as Deputy Clare Daly stated yesterday, if constitutional problems impede us in putting in place an independent policing authority, we should address them instead of deciding that we cannot do something.</p>
                    <p eId="para_141">If the authority is not being asked to hold the commissioner to account, who remains accountable to the Government and the Minister, what is the point in having an authority at all?  The heads proposed that section 41 regarding the Commissioner's duty to keep the Government informed on a wide variety of issues be divided, in that the duty of the Commissioner in policing issues would be owed to the authority while her duty in security of State issues would be owed to the Minister.  However, the Government has rowed back on this proposal, as the published legislation does not change the position under the 2005 Act, in that the Commissioner's duty is to keep the Minister informed on both sets of issues.  The heads set out that only the authority could request a report from the Commissioner on a specific aspect of policing.  This provision has also been rescinded and the Minister still possesses the power to request such a report without even being obliged to share it with the authority.</p>
                    <p eId="para_142">With regard to the management of the audit committee and the accountable role of the Commissioner, a role in respect of which Professor Dermot Walsh was concerned that the published legislation has gone further than the heads, the Minister appears to divest herself of responsibility.</p>
                    <p eId="para_143">No change is proposed to section 47 to provide the authority with crime statistics.  Surely crime statistics should be reported to the authority and not the Minister, or at least to both.  It will be difficult for the authority to deal with police issues if it is not entitled to all the statistical data available.</p>
                    <p eId="para_144">There is no change to section 40 regarding the direct accountability of the Government, including the Minister, as I mentioned before, nor is there a change to subsection 40(2) and the all-encompassing duty of the Commissioner to provide any document or statement in the possession of a garda that the Minister requests.  Professor Walsh has called this an "alarming provision".</p>
                    <p eId="para_145">The Bill, as published, rows back on a commitment in the heads to make the Garda Commissioner fully accountable to the board alone regarding policing matters.  As in the 2005 Act, the Commissioner is to remain solely accountable to the Minister and Government.  This is a fundamental change to the proposal in the heads.  If the authority is not being asked to hold the Commissioner to account and if the Commissioner remains lawfully accountable to the Government and Minister, we will not have the authority-----</p>

                    <p eId="para_147">Amendment No. 102 concerns the accountability section under Part 5.  I am talking about accountability and do not understand how that could not be relevant.  It is part of it.</p>
                    <p eId="para_148">The Commissioner's duty to provide an update regarding policing in the State remains owed to the Minister, not the board.  Again, this is in contrast with what was proposed in the heads.  Recently, policing plans published by the Garda Commissioner before the final legislation was even published refer to the Garda Commissioner looking forward to working with the new authority as part of a collaborative approach.  Clearly, this indicates the Garda Commissioner does not expect to be accountable to the authority and that it is more a case of working alongside it.  If the authority is to have any meaning, the Commissioner will have to be accountable to it.  If the authority does not have this status, it will be very weak.</p>
                    <p eId="para_149">The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission's recommendations are that the authority directly supervise the functioning of the Garda Commissioner's office and the discharge of functions, including the supervision of national security and policing, that the authority discipline, appoint and dismiss senior gardaí, including the Commissioner, that senior gardaí, including the Commissioner, be fully accountable solely to the authority, and that the authority be entitled to issue policy directives to An Garda Síochána.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties also recommended that the Commissioner be accountable to the authority in the performance of his or her functions.  Clearly, the Commissioner will not be accountable to this new body, and the new body will not have the teeth it would require if it were ever to be an independent policing authority.  The arrangement leaves too much to be desired.  The Government can flag it as massive reform and a great step forward, but it does not bear close examination.  It just does not stand up to scrutiny.  We are not alone in believing this.  It is unfortunate that people such as Dr. Vicky Conway and Professor Dermot Walsh were not asked by the Department how they would proceed.  Those individuals are very qualified and very well-informed and they have examined international best practice.  They have a lot to say on how the policing authority should be structured.  It is a missed opportunity that they were not engaged.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p class="indent_1" eId="para_552">In page 7, to delete lines 28 to 30 and substitute the following:</p>
                    <p class="indent_2" eId="para_553">"(b) the principle that effective and efficient policing is dependent on the confidence, support, engagement and cooperation of local communities and every member of the Garda Síochána or member of the civilian staff of the Garda Síochána should, in carrying out his or her functions—</p>
                    <p class="indent_3" eId="para_554">(i) act professionally, ethically and with integrity,</p>
                    <p class="indent_3" eId="para_555">(ii) carry out his or her functions with the aim of securing the support of, and acting in cooperation with, the local community,</p>
                    <p class="indent_3" eId="para_556">and</p>
                    <p class="indent_3" eId="para_557">(iii) be guided by the code of ethics under section 17 (Code of Ethics).".".</p>
                    <p eId="para_558">The amendment deals with the section on policing principles, which should be a cornerstone of the legislation.  We see this very much in the context of our belief that the legislation, rather than being a genuinely reforming document, was a reaction in the midst of the growing outcry and emerging Garda crisis which has occurred over the past year or two.  This brought the Government to recognise reluctantly the need for reform, but it has produced legislation which falls far short.</p>
                    <p eId="para_559">This is very much about setting the goal upfront regarding transforming a police force into a modern police service.  The amendment looks at beefing up the section with the principle that effective and efficient policing would be dependent on the confidence, support, engagement and co-operation of local communities, and that every member of the Garda Síochána or member of the civilian staff of the Garda Síochána should, in carrying out his or her functions, act professionally, ethically and with integrity with the aim of securing the support of, and acting in co-operation with, the local community, and be guided by a code of ethics.</p>
                    <p eId="para_560">On one level, one might say this is ABC stuff and fairly straightforward, but in actual fact it is a million miles away from the manner in which An Garda Síochána has been operating, has been directed to be operated and has been perceived to operate over the past period of time.  Having the support of the community and policing by consent is absolutely vital.  One only has to look at the policing of the anti-water charges protests to realise, and a number of senior gardaí in the communities involved have verified to us, that the Garda has been asked to direct resources to deal with citizens engaged in protest action, often in communities where the police have been trying to build up a rapport and a relationship, and has acted in a heavy-handed way, curtailing the right to protest, which has led to a significant cost and has undermined the integrity of gardaí and how they are viewed locally.</p>
                    <p eId="para_561">The code of ethics part of the legislation is absolutely critical, and we will deal with it later in the course of the debate.  The inclusion of a code of ethics is absolutely vital, but the way in which the Government has put it forward means it has lost all its teeth because there will be no sanction if it is breached.  What is the point of having a code of ethics with no penalties if it is broken?  It means the whole thing is absolutely and utterly toothless.  There is a requirement already in law, under the 2005 Act, requiring the establishment of a code of ethics.  We know that neither the Minister nor any of her predecessors opted to exercise this and bring in a code of ethics.  Where it was to be to there, the idea of breaching it was in secondary legislation and regulation.  We very much wanted to see this at the heart of the Bill, but there is no reference in the Act to the publication of the code of ethics.  The provision included in the Bill is weaker than what was in the 2005 Act, even though nobody initiated or introduced what was in the 2005 Act.  What the measure in the 2005 Act potentially allowed was stronger than what is proposed in the Bill, which is a watering down.</p>
                    <p eId="para_562">In Northern Ireland the code of ethics is substantially stronger.  It is a standard built into every operation of the PSNI and a standard against which it is measured.  Misconduct is investigated against the standard and a key part of it is a focus on human rights compliance and assessing the impact on human rights, including in the annual report.  Unless we have this we will not have policing by consent or the support of the community.  Other than this, it is total lip service, to be honest.  We need to take cognisance of what the experts say in this regard.  The Government's removal of section 123(2)(<i>b</i>) of the 2005 Act, relating to the Minister being able to introduce disciplinary sanction for a breach of ethics, is an enormous row back.  It is a little bit ironic because the Government was making a major play about the code of ethics finally being introduced, but what is being introduced is far weaker than what was in the 2005 Act.  The issue is whether the Government wants a scenario whereby human rights, ethical behaviour and the Garda seeing itself as being very much the servant of the population is built in at the very start of our policing principles.  This is what is at stake in this, which is why we feel it is incredibly important to push it at this stage.</p>

                    <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher</from>
                    <p eId="para_563">There have been many pre-election promises made in recent days.  The Minister for Health has been at it again in outlining his vision of the health services in the years ahead.  I suppose this is to camouflage the fact that the pre-election promises of 2011 have not been fully honoured.  The vast majority of them have been shredded and totally ignored.</p>
                    <p eId="para_564">The Minister for Health made a speech recently to Chartered Accountants Ireland in which he effectively outlined the end of the public health services as we know them.  He said he is strongly of the view that the hospital groups or trusts, if one likes to call them that, should have authority and freedom to make collective agreements, manage their own assets and payroll and negotiate independent contracts to recruit managers and specialists outside of the constraints of public sector rules in the way semi-State bodies now do.  He added, to make things worse, that where these trusts or hospitals consistently underperform in clinical outcomes, patient experience and financial management, it should be open to the provider to transfer management of the hospital for a period to private providers by means of a concession or management contract.</p>
                    <p eId="para_565">There is a strong attachment to the public health service in this country, although it is under-resourced, underfunded and facing major challenges in trying to provide basic levels of service.  That is primarily down to lack of resourcing.  Week in and week out, we have seen illustrations of that in our accident and emergency departments across the country.  There are consistent increases in outpatient and inpatient waiting lists.  Nevertheless, it is important that the Tánaiste, coming towards the end of this Government, outlines whether Labour is in cahoots with the Thatcherite policies of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, when it comes to privatisation of large tracts or our public health services.  Is the Tánaiste in agreement with the concept of farming out our public health services to private management companies, establishing something like an Irish Water, to be managed by an accountancy firm that will not take into account the social need aspects of our public health services?  Will the Tánaiste today assuage the concerns out there that our public health services could be handed over to private management companies in the years ahead if Fine Gael and Labour are returned to office?</p>

                    <p eId="para_566">I understand the speech by the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, was an address to Chartered Accountants Ireland.  I suppose that if he was talking to accountants, he may well have addressed the issue of accountants' roles in the various elements of the health services.</p>

                    <p eId="para_568">The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, was very clearly giving a personal view.  I think he indicated that and these were his wide-ranging thoughts on how the health services might develop as he saw it.  He has done that and it is one of the things that people find very attractive about the Minister, as he engaged in very broad-ranging discussions on his views.  He did that before the last election-----</p>

                    <p eId="para_570">-----and I presume he is doing it now before this election in speaking to a variety of areas.  The Deputy asked if I agree with what he has to say.  I welcome the fact that he is speaking broadly, setting out his own views and giving great thought to them.  It does not mean that anybody has to particularly agree with any or all of his views.  It is a free country with free speech.  In that context, I welcome debate about the future of the health service.</p>

                    <p eId="para_572">The Labour Party view on the health service is rooted in the concept of an organised, efficient, effective and caring health service, delivered for the most part through the public health service.  As the Deputy is aware, it has been delivered for centuries in this country by not-for-profit institutions, many of them religious in origin, which have provided care and health services to generations of Irish people.  That is where our vision of the health service is rooted.</p>
                    <p eId="para_573">We inherited the Deputy's party's vision of the health services in the form of the Health Service Executive.  It is fair to say that when Fianna Fáil were in government, around 2004, it ran away from the responsibility of holding the Department of Health and the senior Ministry it involved.  From there on, Fianna Fáil allocated that portfolio to its then partners in government.</p>

                    <p eId="para_579">Fianna Fáil has a particular history with regard to the HSE and what it was trying to achieve in health services.  We have a health service in this country that comes with a very strong public service ethic.  It is really important that we maintain that to the highest degree.  We also inherited a sector of the health service that is not-for-profit, with much of it originating with religious organisations and bodies in this country.  I see the core of the health service essentially being provided through dedicated public service that puts patients first.</p>
                    <p eId="para_580">As we recover, we have the problem of allocating sufficient resources to meet all the demands of a growing population and health service demands.  Every country in the world, and particularly western Europe, faces that challenge.  It is a challenge that the Labour Party in the last budget, together with our Fine Gael partners in government, has sought to address by allocating very significant additional resources to health services in Ireland.</p>

These are hard-working families, who bought average family homes and are now being dragged through the courts by their lenders.  These are the very same banks that were bailed out by the taxpayer.  Last year, 7,100 families had court proceedings lodged against them.  Over the past nine months of this year, banks have lodged 4,500 eviction proceedings with the courts.  Every month, banks are lodging hundreds of fresh court actions against families in mortgage distress.  Hundreds more families are being coerced by the banks into selling their homes rather than facing the horror of court action.  Why is this happening?  The answer is very simple.  In 2013, the Tanaiste's Government passed the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act, the intention of which was to make it easier for banks to evict people from their homes</p>

                    <p eId="para_689">It has been successful in that endeavour.  The figures speak for themselves.  Before this Act became law, banks lodged between 50 and 100 court actions every month.  After the Act became law, the number exploded to between 500 and 1,000 per month.  That is a tenfold increase.  The Tánaiste opened the floodgates, then she sat back and, once again, let the banks call the shots.  As a result, the number of court-ordered evictions has increased dramatically.  There have been 1,088 in the first nine months of this year.  That compares with 644 during the same period in 2014 and 240 in the same period in 2013.  The pattern is clear.  Where is the recovery for the families who face eviction because of the Tánaiste's actions, what will she and her Government do to keep these people in their homes and when will she stand up to the banks and insist that they provide families with sustainable solutions to mortgage distress?</p>

                    <p eId="para_690">The Government is acutely conscious of the impact of debt on families across the country and we are determined to see that it is resolved.  People have to move forward with their lives and I understand the worry and stress that is involved for people when they have big mortgage debt in respect of their homes.  In other cases, people who got married bought a house and may have held on to an apartment or previous home as they were advised at the time by the bank broadly to do that.  There are many families who have great difficulties with debt and everybody shares an enormous concern that they and their children should be helped as much as possible.  Our priority remains keeping borrowers in their homes whenever this is possible.</p>
                    <p eId="para_691">In relation to the report in<i>The Irish Times</i> this morning, the significant point to make is that the article points out clearly that there is a small, but welcome, fall in the actions before the courts.  In fact, in terms of the detailed information from the courts, 90 to 100 of the cases before the courts are struck out or rescinded on a monthly basis.  They are refused, they are withdrawn or they are struck out.</p>
                    <p eId="para_692">If Deputy McDonald or anybody else is aware of a family who have these kind of difficulties, or an individual who has these difficulties, the most important advice we can give is that they would engage with their lenders.  Where they go to court, the courts deal with the cases in a thoughtful and careful manner.  In fact, there has been detailed research carried out by commentators, such as Mr. Seamus Coffey, Mr. Karl Deeter and Mr. Brendan Burgess, who have written a series of important articles over the past period of time setting out in detail what is likely to happen to borrowers who go into the court process.  There are other studies and statistics showing this as well.  If borrowers engage with their lenders and if it does end up before the courts, the courts are routinely granting significant periods of adjournment in order to give more time for the parties to reach an agreement and where parties are committing to pay within the context of their means, the courts are allowing those arrangements.  It is clear from the court cases to date that in a situation of last resort where it is not possible to reach an agreement or, as has been reported in the articles to which I refer, where many borrowers do not show up in court at all, as a consequence, notwithstanding that the courts are delaying those cases and adjourning them, notwithstanding the fact that the courts are offering time and space for the two parties to mediate and reach an agreement, there are still many borrowers who are not engaging at all.  That is a point of difficulty.  Thankfully, in the figures this morning, notwithstanding that they are far higher than anybody here would want to see, we are now in a situation where, according to the article, "The number of bills lodged fell by 30 per cent".  It is traumatic for anybody to end up in court in relation to their family home.  It is only when we see that figure down to little or nothing that we will be satisfied.  That is what the article and the statistics show, as do the statistics from the Courts Service.  As I say, I note the articles written by respected independent commentators at frequent intervals in the media.</p>

                    <p eId="para_693">I hope the Tánaiste is not trying to shift the blame and suggest that it is non-engagement by families that is causing this difficulty.  I set out clearly for her the consequences of the legislation, the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013, that she championed and brought through this House.  The figures demonstrate the consequences of those actions.</p>
                    <p eId="para_694">The Tánaiste is engaging in a dangerous form of wishful thinking if she believes that this problem has been contained or if she believes that it will miraculously disappear.  That is not the case.  When one talks to those in the field who deal daily with families in mortgage distress, they say that we are merely seeing the beginning of the high point of this crisis.  That is the reality.</p>

In what framework could anybody understand voluntary surrender or eviction to be sustainable solutions for any family?  We are faced already with a chronic housing and homelessness crisis right across the State.</p>
                    <p eId="para_697">The Tánaiste offered in her response simply tea and sympathy for these families - even that was fairly lukewarm.  She is not offering solutions.  I put it to her, because this is the bottom line for tens of thousands of families across the State, that it is about debt write-down.</p>

If Deputy McDonald is interested in a solution for borrowers that helps them away from the dreadful worry and stress of being in debt, the worst that can happen is that borrowers deny that there is a problem.  I am saying only one in five borrowers shows up in the court.  What we are doing to help borrowers?</p>

                    <p eId="para_739">The Department assessment is based solely on eligibility, not on suitability.  People who are destined to fail are being put on CE schemes.  It is also delaying the completion process of the particular course, given that people are joining schemes for which they are not ready.  Insurance costs for CE have rocketed from €50 to €150 per participant.  This increase must be met out of existing budgets which are already very stretched and which also include material and programme grants.</p>
                    <p eId="para_740">CE is being measured as a labour activation programme, which it is.  However, it is much more than that, and the measurements are not taking it into account, for example, progression routes and the services CE schemes are providing.</p>
                    <p eId="para_741">People aged 18 to 21 who are unemployed and not in education or training cannot avail of CE schemes.  They are a strong target group which should be joining CE schemes to avail of education and training.  The double payment is gone, and there is a need to incentivise lone parents to join CE schemes, particularly those that offer training in child care.  As well as earning a FETAC level 5 qualification for themselves, participants boost their own parenting skills and personal development.  The €20 extra is not enough.  It does not cover the travel costs for some participants.  It is costing them more.  These are people in receipt of basic social welfare payments.  There are communities which depend on the services provided by CE, especially child care.  If there is a problem with CE, there will be a problem with the child care service.  If child care services go from communities of great need, it will be very costly in the long run.</p>
                    <p eId="para_742">CE has also been positive in terms of integration of new communities and Traveller communities.  Although the system should be facilitating the participants and communities, it is not keeping up with the reality.  The rules are very stringent.  CE works when there is flexibility, particularly flexibility in those areas of great need.  The Minister has met representatives of CE schemes and had very frank and open discussions with them.  There is a need to meet again and resolve the issues which prevent CE schemes from continuing and doing the work they can do.</p>

                    <p eId="para_744">I thank the Deputy.  I appreciate what she said regarding the importance of the services that CE schemes deliver throughout the country.  There are more than 1,000 CE schemes and more than 22,000 people participate in schemes.  They make an enormous contribution to their local communities and provide a range of services, including helping with services for older and retired people, after-school clubs and sporting organisations, especially the GAA and soccer clubs, to maintain local sport services and a range of local community services.</p>
                    <p eId="para_745">I am aware there have been issues with rising insurance costs across the board.  My Department is very aware of it and is working on it.  When the CE schemes came under the Department of Social Protection, some of the schemes were paying very high insurance rates.  The Department negotiated deals to reduce the cost of insurance.  There have been demands for increased insurance charges and we are working to address them.  I will come back to the Deputy about it.  I am waiting for a number of officials to finalise some improvements in it.</p>
                    <p eId="para_746">Participants in CE schemes will see a small increase in the allowance of €2.50 per week from 1 January.  Participants in receipt of a fuel allowance will also receive an increase in their fuel allowance of €2.50 per week from 1 January.</p>

                    <p eId="para_748">While I appreciate these are small amounts, it has been the first significant improvement.  As well as emphasising improvements for older and retired people over 66, I have made a point of ensuring all participants in any schemes will receive an increase in their total social welfare payments from 1 January.</p>

                    <p eId="para_749">I raised very specific issues and they need very specific answers.  I draw the Minister's attention to an issue that is common to CE schemes and the designated places for people in rehabilitation.  It is the role of the CE supervisor in areas of great need.  These supervisors are seeing people who are presenting with much more complex needs than in the past, who have barely enough to live on and who are in receipt of the basic social welfare payment.  They are dealing with women and families who are coming from homeless and emergency accommodation.  Some are coming to CE with care plans.  They are working with the children of those in addiction, who have more and greater needs.  They are seeing women who are hungry, and CE schemes are providing breakfast and lunch out of their materials and programmes budgets.  They are seeing increasing levels of poverty.</p>
                    <p eId="para_750">The role of the CE supervisor is much more demanding.  It is much more than an administrative role.  Discussions are taking place in ENDRIC between the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Health.  ENDRIC sees CE as part of a point of rehabilitation in community care for some of the participants.  However, it is not being supported in the way ENDRIC sees it should be.  The supervisors are case managing and key working, and they need more training in those areas, not in payroll or administration, in which they are already proficient.  Some of the supervisors I met are being innovative and some of the schemes have devised new programmes.  For example the SAOL Project has initiated Reduce the Use.  They are also involved in restorative practice.  Another amazing programme is the capacitor programme, which we could consider rolling out into many youth projects.</p>
                    <p eId="para_751">CE programmes could do with better staff ratios and more rehab places, yet despite all the barriers and difficulties they are doing amazing work in these areas of great need.  However, given the stringency of the rules and regulations, the system it is not keeping up with the reality of the people and communities who are in great need of CE.  I ask the Tánaiste to examine the role of the supervisor.</p>

                    <p eId="para_753">The Deputy refers to particular schemes that are involved with the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Health.  After I became Minister, I provided for 1,000 ring-fenced places in schemes which cater for and assist people who are in rehabilitation from drugs.  These places continue to exist.  Over recent years as demand for such services has spread out more widely throughout the country, we have initiated further schemes or parts of schemes in places such as Waterford and Wexford to help people there who have issues.  People who go into rehabilitation need to be able to progress themselves by getting back into education or employment or by getting the kind of experience that is provided through the community employment scheme.  We have maintained all of that intact.  As a result of the discussions that have taken place with the relevant groups, some of which have not involved the Department of Social Protection, a broad framework agreement on the next steps has almost been completed.  I am aware that the Departments of Health and Justice and Equality and, in particular, the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, are strongly committed to this.  I anticipate that we will be able to announce that agreement in the not too distant future.  We have continued to fund community employment in this way.  I assure the Deputy that we will continue to do so because it is an important pathway to sustained recovery for many people who have experienced drugs and addiction issues.</p>
                    <p eId="para_754">I would like to respond to the Deputy's earlier point about how people are selected for community employment courses.  I suggest that if she has some specific examples, I will take them back to the Department.  We have opened community employment up to younger people and we are also opening it up to older people.  As people get back to work in Ireland and as this country starts to work back to full employment, two groups of people may continue to have the difficulties they have at present.  In the first case, which relates to younger people under the age of 25, we are building up apprenticeships and First Steps programmes to help them to identify career plans.  In the second case, which relates to older people who may have lost their jobs or taken early retirement deals, we are conscious that such people would be delighted to be involved in and contribute to their local communities through community employment.  We should avail of the experience, wisdom and community caring that older people so often provide in a community employment context.</p>

                    <p eId="para_756">In addition, community employment is one of the avenues that can be used to give opportunities to younger people.  We have opened up to Tús to self-referral.  Some 20% of Tús placements can now be made by people applying and putting themselves forward.  Like the community employment scheme, Tús has proven to be very popular throughout the country.  As we have been saying about community employment, Tús does some very valuable work.  If the Deputy knows people who might like to be involved in community employment but have not got one of their choices, she should remind them to look at the Tús openings that may be available in their local areas.  We are providing for self-referral.  Tús has done an enormous volume of work in towns, villages and areas right around the country.  Those involved have worked on simple things like tidy towns, which are so important for neighbourhoods.  They have done very valuable work in the community.  For example, they have worked with older people on home repairs that may be required.  If the Deputy sends any specific details to me, I will be happy to go through them in detail.</p>

                    <p eId="para_762">The Minister, Deputy Kelly, has belatedly made some broad announcements in recent times about how he proposes to deal with the issues facing people who are homeless and people in private rented accommodation whose rents are escalating.  He has said that people should approach the Private Residential Tenancies Board in cases of disputes or disagreements between landlords and tenants, but I remind the House that the number of staff employed by the board has decreased by almost 50%.  Given that an avalanche of people will approach the Private Residential Tenancies Board as a result of the stated policy of the Minister, Deputy Kelly, would it not be appropriate at this stage to increase the number of staff working in the board, which is grossly understaffed by any stretch of the imagination?  Perhaps that issue can be addressed in the short term.  Will legislation be required to fast-track planning for the modular units that are being proposed to deal with the housing crisis and the homelessness on our streets?  The stated policy of the Minister is that the units in question will be in place in advance of Christmas.</p>

It is a bit of a cheap shot on the part of Deputy McDonald to suggest that the Minister, by taking time to look at the learning from those various reports on what happened to those poor, unfortunate families, is delaying this very important element of our national public health service.

All I am saying is that it would be very foolish of any Government or any Member of this House not to take on board the learning of the trauma that those families suffered when they lost their precious babies.  If that is one of the reasons for the Minister taking his time about establishing a new authority and consulting widely, then I believe he has done a wise thing and the proper thing.  The Deputy may differ from me on that because she wants instant shots on everything.  He has done the wise thing and it will, of course, be dealt with.  The Minister gave an extensive interview this morning.  It is coming into force now and he has dealt with it properly and wisely.</p>
                    <p eId="para_844">The last issue the Deputy raised is a matter for CPP.  The Deputy should address her remarks there.  I would just say, of the tragedy that befell the Traveller families in the fire in Carrickmines, that again the Deputy is trying to be very divisive by suggesting that other people who differ politically from her do not actually have concerns about what happened in terms of the dreadful loss of life and are not reaching out to provide, as best as possible, for those families in their grief and trauma.  Deputy McDonald does not have a monopoly on lecturing the rest of us on how we should respond to human events.  I am looking at Deputies here who would be of a different persuasion to Sinn Féin who went to those funerals, who actually talked with the families and met with people from the Traveller community.  That is as important and valuable as Deputy McDonald's particular shouty concerns here this morning.  Making politics of that, in a crude way, is wrong.  Finally-----</p>

However, it is entirely inappropriate for any Member to berate the Ceann Comhairle, whoever the Ceann Comhairle may be, because in this particular instance the Ceann Comhairle did nothing more than deal with a complaint that was made to him.

                    <p eId="para_887">I will briefly raise three issues.  With regard to the Bill proposed by Deputy Penrose to introduce a one-year bankruptcy period, the Taoiseach made some positive comments on the legislation yesterday.  Will the Tánaiste give an assurance that the Bill will be enacted and operational before the end of the year?</p>
                    <p eId="para_888">On electroconvulsive therapy or ECT, we heard reports today that the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, proposes to introduce legislation to deal with this issue before the end of this Dáil term.  Are these reports correct and, if so, in the context of what legislation will ECT be addressed?</p>
                    <p eId="para_889">I refer the Tánaiste to the Constitutional Convention, an issue we have raised consistently at meetings of the Whips.  In fairness to the Government Whip, he has always been willing to facilitate debate on the reports of the Constitutional Convention.  Yesterday, a number of Members received invitations to an event with the title Irish Citizens Decide: A Review of the Convention on the Constitution.  The people chosen to participate in the Constitutional Convention expressed considerable satisfaction with the convention and there was a lot of ruaille buaille on the part of the Government at its launch.  The convention was supposed to facilitate a revolution in the political process, yet not one of the deadlines the Government set for itself in respect of dealing with the reports of the Constitutional Convention has been met.  Is the Tánaiste embarrassed to learn that a seminar will be held on Friday to discuss the Constitutional Convention, given that four of its reports still have not been debated in the House?</p>

I am happy to say that at midnight on Sunday, one of the most significant recommendations made by the Constitutional Convention, which was on the introduction of marriage equality, will come into full legal force in a significantly reduced timeframe.  This is due to the general co-operation and support of citizens - the most important element - for the referendum as well as of all the parties.  I thank all the parties and Independent Deputies for the robust and deep discussions which took place in a very timely manner.  As a consequence, we will see marriage equality come into effect from midnight on Sunday.  That is a tribute to the Constitutional Convention.</p>

                    <p eId="para_972">I will make one brief point.  Motions providing for guillotines on Committee Stage are often used and I presume that is the purpose of this motion.  The House has had little time to discuss the budget or Finance Bill.  It is a tradition to apply guillotines on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  However, the guillotine was used on the Second Stage debate of the Finance Bill and the debate on the budget was also very short.  It did not allow many Deputies to contribute to the debate.  I note our disappointment on that.</p>

                    <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
                    <p eId="para_975">The amendment deals with a new section on the idea of policing principles, which is welcome.  However, it also gets to the heart of one of our objections to the Bill, which is the way in which the Government has rowed back between the publication of the heads of the Bill a year ago and the final product before us now.  The idea of a code of ethics to guide gardaí in carrying out their functions was included by the Government under the new policing principles section in the heads of the Bill but it has been removed from the final draft.  That sends a completely and utterly wrong signal.  The way in which gardaí behave and how accountable they are to the public is critical to how the legislation is viewed overall.</p>
                    <p eId="para_976">To give an example, we were contacted early this morning by an older couple from the country.  Earlier this year, their house was raided by armed gardaí allegedly looking for drugs.  They did not find any drugs and there were no drugs or anything like that there.  The couple felt incredibly vulnerable on foot of their experience.  They made the point that they were not shown any warrant or authorisation to search the property.  Nothing like that had ever happened to them before and they had no idea what to expect.  They made the point that the gardaí who attended were incredibly polite, courteous and well behaved towards them and that they reinstated the property after the search as much as possible.  They left it relatively tidy.</p>
                    <p eId="para_977">Why is this important?  It is important on the one hand because the unfortunate interaction with An Garda Síochána resulted in them being treated respectfully and ethically on the one hand by some of the gardaí who attended but on the other hand the behaviour was not so good because proper procedures in terms of producing a warrant were not followed.  That has had a devastating impact on the family.  They had never had an interaction with gardaí over the course of the decades of their lives before.  Since this incident, they have felt embarrassed around their neighbours.  They were told they could get money back from the State Claims Agency for the damage that was done to their property but they have not been able to access that subsequently.  They are suffering from health problems, waking up in the night and getting upset by noises in the house because of the experience they have been through.</p>
                    <p eId="para_978">When people interact with An Garda Síochána, it leaves a legacy.  It can be a positive or a negative one.  The purpose of the Bill and an independent authority to set a standard which can be independently scrutinised was proposed by us to increase confidence in An Garda Síochána.  It was proposed on behalf of the decent gardaí who want to do the job they signed up for in the first place.  The Government taking out and diluting a code of ethics is one of the most substantial aspects of the Bill.  The Government had included it in the section under discussion in the heads of the Bill, but it has now removed it.  I want to know why that is the case.</p>
                    <p eId="para_979">I also want to know the following.  As it stands under the 2007 disciplinary regulations, a breach of a code of ethics, which has not been introduced by any Minister to date, would have constituted a breach of discipline.  However, the regulations are secondary legislation and can obviously be revoked at any point by the Minister.  The regulations are being removed in terms of the Bill before us.  What we now have is the removal of the section that allowed a breach of a code of ethics to constitute a breach of discipline.  The Minister, who I think is still in Malta, can ignore this part of it.  She has been proclaiming that the Bill provides for a code of ethics for the first time, but this is not true.  Provision already existed for a code of ethics but we should be very clear that the legislation before us waters it down.  It means that where a garda breaches the code, there will be no sanction.  This is unbelievable and a great example of the rowing back undertaken by the Government.  We will make more points about the code of ethics but I would like the Minister of State to deal with why the Government removed it from the section between the heads of Bill being put forward and the final draft of the Bill.</p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#MickWallace" eId="spk_425">
                    <from>Deputy Mick Wallace</from>
                    <p eId="para_980">Rather than going into the things we are looking for in amendment No. 7, which Deputy Daly has highlighted, I note that the policing principles section of the legislation should include reference to a code of ethics.  The 2005 Act provided that the Minister shall establish by regulation a code of ethics, including conduct and practice for members of An Garda Síochána following consultation with the Garda Commission, GSOC and the then Irish Human Rights Commission and having regard to European standards.  Neither the current nor any previous Minister ever did this.  It is a major problem.  We have never given gardaí a code of ethics to work towards.  Can Members imagine the confusion this has the potential to cause?</p>
                    <p eId="para_981">There is a barracks in Kilkenny with approximately 60 gardaí in it and there is great inconsistency in how they work.  Some of the gardaí are upset at the behaviour of others.  Some really good gardaí feel that others do not behave as well as they should.  I brought this up in the Chamber a year ago and I wrote recently to the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner about the issue.  The Field Bar in Kilkenny has suffered a campaign of intimidation and bullying that has gone on for seven years.  The owners and staff have been affected.  It is hard to credit what has happened there.  After I raised this issue last year, everything stopped for a while.  Complaints were made to GSOC.  Many of them were out of date.  Seven were not, but they are still being investigated a year later without result.  Reportedly, there has been poor co-operation from the Garda.  Good gardaí in Kilkenny are finding it difficult to oppose those who are responsible for poor behaviour.  One wonders how this might happen, but we do not have a code of ethics to tell gardaí how they are supposed to behave ethically when carrying out their jobs.  Surely guidelines on behaviour would be essential for anyone with such a responsible job.</p>
                    <p eId="para_982">In 290 days of trading this year, the pub in question was visited by some gardaí 146 times.  That is unbelievable.  Its competitors are not suffering this and an investigation is warranted.  There are good and honest gardaí who are not happy with what is happening, but it is as if people believe that they can get away with doing this.  They stopped for a few months after I complained in the Chamber last year, but their confidence returned and they started again.  Recently, one of the bar's staff stated that it was like being under siege constantly.  This is difficult on the staff and the man and woman's children, who do not understand what is happening.  This couple made a living in New York for years before returning home, buying the Field Bar, doing it up and running a business as anyone would.  Their children are aghast that someone can suffer this in a country like Ireland.</p>
                    <p eId="para_983">The amendment is connected to this matter.  Poor behaviour is sometimes directly linked with the lack of a code of ethics.  The pub gets fined all of the time for late openings even if the staff are only cleaning up, which warrants an investigation.  It got fined again a few weeks ago.  Two gardaí arrested the wife, bundled her into a van and brought her to their barracks.  They let her out an hour later after the fine was paid.  This is not normal.  Two weeks ago, I wrote to the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner about it.  I hope that they do something about it, as it is very bad.</p>
                    <p eId="para_984">Under the Bill, the authority will set a code of ethics, but the clause making a breach of the code of ethics a breach of discipline, as mentioned in the heads of the Bill in November 2014, has been removed.  What is the rational explanation for this?  It beggars belief.  Under the 2007 disciplinary regulations, a breach of a code of ethics, if one existed, would be a breach of discipline.  This provision is included in the 2005 Act.  However, the regulations are only secondary legislation and can be revoked at any point by the Minister's executive power.  In subsequent amendments, we will argue that a code of ethics should be included in the Bill and any breach of such a code should constitute a breach of discipline and be sanctioned accordingly.  If sanctions are not in place, what is the point?  We have serious problems, but it is as if the Government is pretending that they do not exist.</p>
                    <p eId="para_985">Eighteen months ago, we all acknowledged that everything was not well with policing.  There was a great deal of fanfare and claims that changes would be made.  The then Garda Commissioner, Minister for Justice and Equality and Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality went, but nothing has changed.  Despite the GSOC Bill, GSOC is still not fit for purpose because it has no power to hold the Garda to account.  The Government went through the charade of introducing legislation, but that was toothless.  We are now setting up a so-called independent policing authority, but the Government hand picked its head and will hand pick the rest of its personnel.  The authority will not be independent - it will be a pup of the Government, another quango.  We were in favour of an independent policing authority, but it would have been better for matters to stay as they were because we have created a fig leaf of independence.  It is not a buffer between the Garda and the Minister.  The Minister's paws are all over it, it has no real power and it is not independent of the Government of the day.  We will continue to have problems with policing until we depoliticise it, but the established parties obviously do not want that.  This is a shame.</p>
                    <p eId="para_986">Good gardaí - whistleblowers - have come forward in recent years.  The likes of Maurice McCabe, John Wilson, Nicky Keogh, Keith Harrison and, in Cork, Jack Doyle have stuck out their necks.  There are many more.  Many people are proud to be a part of policing in Ireland and love the idea of being in an organisation that looks after the security of the State, individuals and communities, but many are not happy with how it is panning out.  It could be so much better.  Everything was not right a number of years ago, but there was a greater dimension of policing with people's consent.  Sadly, that is disappearing.  The Garda is now seen as more of a police force than a police service.  The Government has a major responsibility to address this problem.</p>

                    <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport  (Deputy Ann Phelan)</from>
                    <p eId="para_987">Section 5 inserts a new section 3B into the principal Act, which sets out the policing principles that will underpin the provision of policing services.  Under these principles, policing should be conducted independently, impartially, in accordance with the law and in a manner that respects human rights and supports the proper and effective administration of justice.  Such principles are a feature of the legislation underpinning the police services in Northern Ireland, Scotland and New Zealand.</p>
                    <p eId="para_988">The Deputies' amendments seek to replace the text in the Bill with text from the general scheme of the Bill that related to the principles.  The Deputies will be aware that a general scheme is not of itself law.  Rather, it purports to set out the general policy requirements that are sought to be included in the legislation when drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  Following discussions between the Minister's officials, parliamentary counsel and legal advisers in the Office of the Attorney General, the provision relating to policing principles was developed to set out a series of overarching and guiding principles to underpin the provision of policing services in the State rather than to impose specific requirements on individual members of the Garda Síochána.  This is not to say that the specific requirements in the amendments should not inform members in carrying out their day-to-day duties, though.</p>
                    <p eId="para_989">In this context, I draw the Deputies' attention to the solemn declaration under section 16 of the principal Act that is made by each garda before a peace commissioner.  Each member declares that he or she will faithfully discharge the duties of a member of the Garda Síochána with fairness, integrity, regard for human rights, diligence and impartiality, upholding the Constitution and the laws and according equal respect to all people.  Furthermore, each declares he or she will, to the best of his or her skill and knowledge, discharge all duties according to law.  In the circumstances, the Minister invites the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.</p>

                <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_427">
                    <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
                    <p eId="para_990">We certainly will not be withdrawing it.  I am a little surprised the Minister of State did not deal with the issue raised, which concerned why the Government removed the proposal from the heads of the Bill concerning the section in question.  I know from what she said that the Attorney General, who popped up in another scenario similar to this one, is being used but she did not say the proposal is not possible in this instance because it was obviously in the heads.</p>
                    <p eId="para_991">Comparing this State with Northern Ireland is completely disingenuous because it is precisely under this clause that Northern Ireland is leaps and bounds ahead of us.  The North accords its code of ethics a far stronger status.  It represents a standard by which the police are measured there.  In fact, the Chief Constable in the North is obliged by law to ensure all his officers have read and understood the code.  This requirement was in the heads of the Bill but was taken out in the final draft.  It is important to note that the policing principles in the North set out that when carrying out their functions, the police must be guided by the code of ethics, which again gives the code added status.  The board in the North includes an assessment in its annual report as to the performance of the police in this regard.  Therefore, there is a completely different ballgame in the North.  It would be far more accurate to state the amendment before the House in our names is precisely seeking to have a Northern Ireland scenario whereby a code of ethics would be given status and all ranks of the Garda would be required to behave in accordance therewith.  The Garda Commissioner would be accountable for enforcing it.  The reason, as outlined by Deputy Wallace, is precisely because there is a need for public scrutiny of Garda behaviour.  There is a need to have democratic accountability in the Garda as a result of some horrendous activities that have been ongoing in this State over years.  We need to include the code to guide behaviour in the interest of all in society.</p>

                    <p eId="para_992">We do not expect our amendments to be accepted; that is what happens in here.  It is good that we get a chance to discuss them, however, except in the case of those that are ruled out of order.</p>
                    <p eId="para_993">It would be great if there were a rethink of how the policing authority is being set up.  It really could represent a breakthrough but it will not in its current form.  There will actually be no change at all.  If the Government does nothing else in its remaining term in office, it should talk to Dr. Vicky Conway and Professor Dermot Walsh, who know more about this than any of us.  We are not asking the Government to talk to us.  The Government should determine what the experts think about how best to move forward.  Time spent talking to them would be time well spent.  We will not be crowing, "We won, we won."  We want things to be done right and do not give out about policing for the sake of it.  It would be great if things were different.  Dr. Conway and Professor Walsh could make a huge contribution and the Government should listen to them.  It is not too late.  I admit it would be unorthodox to talk to them.  I do not have a problem with unorthodoxy, as the Minister of State might suspect, and believe the Government should buy into my philosophy on this occasion.</p>

                    <p eId="para_994">The reason we are going on about this amendment is we believe it to be a particularly important component of what we are trying to achieve in the multiple amendments we have tabled.  Unfortunately, many of the really important amendments to be moved later in the context of the composition of the authority itself, amendments we believe are critical to its independence, have been ruled out of order.  Therefore, we will not get a chance to discuss them.  However, we must step back and examine this matter strategically and determine why we are considering a new Garda authority.  It is because of the behaviour of gardaí that came into the spotlight in recent times.  In many ways, it is nothing new.  We had the Morris tribunal and, in fairness, we had the findings of the Smithwick inquiry, which implied gardaí praised the pack mentality ahead of honesty.  People throughout the country have experience of the blue wall of silence being alive and well.  It is actually heroic gardaí at the centre of the organisation who have allowed the spotlight to be put on this issue for the first time in many decades.  In that sense, this is an opportunity we should not ignore.</p>
                    <p eId="para_995">We all know that in the lifetime of this Dáil, because of the work done by the whistleblowing gardaí who brought to light the malpractice associated with penalty points, many citizens began to come out of the closet and tell stories about their own experiences at the hands of the Garda.  Quite often, these were just ordinary people going about their business when some event caused them to have dealings with the Garda.  In many instances, it was a tragedy, such as the death of a loved one in unexplained and horrific circumstances, on foot of which the investigation was not handled appropriately.  The family might not have been dealt with sympathetically, information might have been covered up and people might have been kept in the dark.  This is the stuff that separates the population from the gardaí and that prevents us from having policing by consent or a police service that sees its role as being to serve the public rather than cover up for its mistakes or, worse, deliberate wrongdoing.  It is just not good enough.</p>
                    <p eId="para_996">We have discussed repeatedly in the House the independent review mechanism that the Minister set up on foot of all the cases coming to light.  It has been our assertion that this process was actually to derail the spotlight being put on these issues rather than make any serious attempt to deliver transparency.  We do not say that lightly or in a mean way; we are saying it based on the experience of those hundreds of citizens who, in good faith, gave information to the panel for assessment and who, from what we can see, have been told in 95% of cases that it will not be investigated any further.  Every day, we still get cases on our desks of people who are having poor experiences.  One tragic case that was before the tribunal involves the family of a Mr. John Kelly who was found in the canal in the Dublin docklands in 2008.  There are very serious allegations of unexplained information concerning John's death.  His sisters live in Australia and his mother, who has obviously been traumatised by the experience, lives in Dublin.  In the relatively recent past, gardaí visited that woman with information on John's death that had been given to them over a year ago.  Allegedly, it contained names of people who were present on the night of his death.  A year later, gardaí arrived at the bereaved mother's door not to investigate the death based on the new evidence but to say they want to investigate the content of the letters.  The family is not being co-operated with properly.  It is already bereaved and has probably been tipped over the edge by this.  Like Deputy Wallace, the family has written to both the Minister and the Commissioner, again receiving no answers.  It does not augur well for confidence in the police force.</p>
                    <p eId="para_997">The behaviour of gardaí should be laid down in the principles.  We must set out why somebody would want to become a garda and the standard by which he or she should be held to account.  We are trying to put it in law and up front that they are a service, that they are human-rights-compliant, and that they should be deemed to be behaving ethically.  To be quite frank, a lot of the behaviour that we have come across has not been ethical in any way whatsoever.  It would not give confidence to citizens to go to the Garda if they are in trouble.  That is a pretty shocking thing for anybody to have to say, but we would certainly believe it based on our experience.  Therefore, we are making a final plea to the Minister of State.  This, or at least a part of it, was in the heads of the Bill.  If the Bill is to mean anything at all, it has to be reinstated.  We would really like it to be included in the Bill.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1103">In page 8, to delete lines 6 to 22 and substitute the following:</p>
                    <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1104">. (1) Subject to this section, the appointment of a person to be the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána shall be made by the Authority following consultation with the Government.</p>
                    <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1105">(2) The Authority shall not appoint a person under subsection (1) unless it has invited the Service to undertake a selection competition for that purpose and the Service has undertaken such a competition.</p>
                    <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1106">(3) The Authority shall agree with the Service the selection criteria and process that are to apply to the selection competition under this section.</p>
                    <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1107">(4) A person shall not be appointed by the Authority under subsection (1) unless it is satisfied that the person is suitable for appointment as the Garda Commissioner by reason of his or her possessing such relevant experience, qualifications, training or expertise as is appropriate having regard, in particular, to the functions assigned to the Garda Commissioner by or under this Act.".</p>
                    <p eId="para_1108">It is a little mad that we are discussing approximately 70 amendments together.  Anyway, we do not make the rules.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1109">It is clear what this amendment is about.  We are seeking to have taken out of the Bill the following text in section 8: "the appointment of a person to be the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána shall, upon the nomination of the Authority, be made by the Government."  We reckon the decision should be made by the authority.  We also want to remove the proposed section 9(2) that would amend the principal Act.  This subsection begins: "The Authority shall not nominate a person under subsection (1) unless it has, with the prior approval in writing of the Government..."  The proposed section 9(3) begins: "The Authority shall, with the approval of the Minister..."  I could not make this up.  The idea that the authority has any real power is simply not true.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1110">All of this is under part 2, entitled Personnel and Organisation of Garda Síochána Appointments.  Section 9 of the 2005 Act provides that the appointment of the Garda Commissioner shall be made by Government.  Let us consider the current situation before we move on.  Section 10 of the 2005 Act provides that the Government may appoint as many deputy and assistant commissioners as it chooses.  Section 11 provides that the Government may remove any of these office-holders for stated reasons, including because "the person has failed to perform the functions of the office with due diligence and effectiveness or, in the case of the Garda Commissioner, has failed to have regard to any of the matters specified in section 26 (2)."</p>
                    <p eId="para_1111">Section 13 sets out that the Government may also appoint as many superintendents or chief superintendents as it wishes.  It also sets out that the Garda Commissioner can appoint however many persons to the rank of Garda sergeant and inspector as the Commissioner sees fit.  The Act goes on to say that, with the consent of the Government, the Commissioner may dismiss them if, because of their conduct, their continued membership might undermine public confidence in the Garda Síochána and dismissal is necessary to maintain that confidence.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1112">Under the 2005 Act, the Government alone makes the appointments of the Garda Commissioner and deputy and assistant commissioners and the Government alone may remove them.  The policing Bill we introduced provided that the board would make the appointments and could remove the Garda Commissioner and deputy and assistant commissioners following consultation with the Minister.  Moreover, we provided that the board would appoint superintendents and chief superintendents in consultation with the Minister.  We left the Commissioner with the power to make appointments below the rank of inspector and the power to dismiss them for the same reasons, but with the consent of the board instead of the consent of the Government.  Our Bill also set out that the board, in consultation with the Minister, would decide the number of appointments to the rank of chief superintendent and superintendent.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1113">The new Bill under consideration sets out in section 8 that the Garda Commissioner and any deputy Garda commissioners are to be appointed by the Government.  The section states that the Government shall accept the nomination of the authority.  However, the authority can only nominate in accordance with the recommendation of the Public Appointments Service, which will provide the authority with one name only.  There is not much merit in that.  Before even asking the PAS to undertake a selection competition, the authority must seek prior written approval from Government to do so.  The authority must also get the approval of the Minister before agreeing the selection criteria and the process with the Public Appointments Service for the competition.  Furthermore, the Government may veto the authority's nomination in exceptional circumstances where it has stated the reasons.  The Government can request a new nomination from the authority, which shall make that nomination unless the authority disagrees with the Government's reasons and wishes to make representations to the Government.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1114">It is not clear what will happen.  Could the authority refuse?  We do not know.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1115">Section 8 also sets out that if the Garda Commissioner or any deputy resigns, he or she addresses his or her letter of notification to the Minister and the Government notifies the authority later that the Commissioner or deputy has resigned.  This is not remotely similar to the Bill or policing authority we envisaged.  Under the Government's new Bill, removal from office may be by Government decision alone, with only a duty to consult the authority if the reason relates to policing services for the same reason as set out in the 2005 Act.  The authority can only recommend to the Government that the Commissioner or deputy commissioner be removed if the reason relates to policing services, and in any event the Government is only obliged to consider that recommendation and has no obligation to act upon it.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1116">The Government's Bill also provides that the Government, for policing and State security reasons, and the authority, in terms of policing services, have the power to remove assistant commissioners, chief superintendents and superintendents.  It is also proposed that the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform would determine the number of appointments to assistant Garda commissioner, chief superintendent and superintendent level, but that the authority may make these appointments, subject to a selection competition and any regulations made.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1117">However, that means that the system under the 2006 and 2014 regulations remains in place.  It is not a case of selection by the Public Appointments Service but rather that the promotions advisory council and promotions advisory board, controlled by the Commissioner and Minister, will decide on the candidates the authority will be asked to rubber-stamp.  The heads of the Bill in November were different and proposed a cleaner division.  The Commissioner or deputy commissioner may be removed by the Government on recommendation of the authority for policing reasons, and the Government could dismiss him or her for State security reasons.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1118">The authority alone had the power in the heads of the Bill to remove assistant Garda commissioners, chief superintendents and superintendents from their positions, but in the Bill as drafted the Government and the authority have the power.  Thus, the authority is weaker again in this regard than in the original heads of the Bill.  There was no mention in the heads of the Bill of the Public Appointments Service in the appointment of Commissioners, deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1119">It is difficult to see how An Garda Síochána can be expected to function as a cohesive and disciplined body when, depending on one's rank, one can be removed by, and is thus answerable to, one or two of three different bodies, namely, the Government, the authority and the Government or the Commissioner.  Further confusion arises when one body appoints and another has the power to remove.  For example, in the case of assistant commissioners, chief superintendents and superintendents, where the authority makes appointments, at least nominally, the Minister decides how many appointments are to be made and the authority and the Commissioner can remove them.  It is sowing the seeds for confusion.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1120">The Bill states the authority shall have full power of appointment of the Garda Commissioner, subject only to consultation with the Government.  It is unfair and irrational to ask the authority to be responsible for systemic issues and policies and for performance issues when it cannot appoint or remove those responsible for implementing those policies and priorities.  Given that the assistant commissioner, chief superintendent and superintendent all work within a hierarchal structure under the Commissioner and deputy commissioners who are appointed by the Government, giving the authority the power to appoint and remove them is meaningless.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1121">Furthermore, this power of the authority is largely circumscribed by existing regulations regarding promotion, which will continue.  Through these regulations, the Minister and Commissioner will continue to make these decisions through their proxies on the promotion board.  It is also unfair and irrational to expect the authority to be responsible for resources, budgets and staffing if it has no part to play in deciding the number of appointments to be made to senior management ranks, such as assistant chief superintendent and superintendents.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1122">Dr. Vicky Conway said that the authority should have responsibility for the appointment of the Commissioner, with the approval of the Minister, and that serious consideration should be given to allowing the authority to appoint other senior ranks such as deputy commissioner and assistant commissioner.  She also recommended that the authority should have the power to request the Commissioner to retire.  The Irish Human Rights Council and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, recommended that an authority be responsible for the appointment of senior managers, including the Commissioner, but the Government has failed to take their recommendations on board.  Once again, I ask it to reconsider the decision.</p>

                    <p eId="para_1123">This is an important part of the Bill.  It is utter lunacy that we are discussing 74 amendments together, but we will try to do our best.  This critical section deals with appointments.  It was one of the key parts of the Bill in terms of all the submissions from NGOs, statutory human rights bodies, other organisations and policing experts who were consulted.  Let us examine the current Bill.  Under the current Garda Síochána Act 2005, the Government alone appoints the Garda Commissioner, the deputy commissioner and assistant commissioners.  It alone can remove all these ranks for any stated reason, including but not limited to disobeying a directive from the Minister.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1124">The Bill put forward by Deputy Wallace on two occasions and which has passed Second Stage provided for the board to make those appointments and remove people at Garda Commissioner, deputy commissioner and assistant commissioner level following consultation with the Minister.  It also proposed that it should be the board that appoints superintendents and chief superintendents, in consultation with the Minister.  It left the Commissioner with the power to make only appointments below the rank of inspector and to dismiss them for the same reasons, with the consent of the board rather than the Government.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1125">Our Bill sought to put the board centre stage and give it the teeth and ability to do what it is supposed to do, namely, be an independent oversight of the functioning of An Garda Síochána.  How can one oversee an organisation if one is not charged with responsibility for putting in place the people at the helm of the organisation?  It takes any credibility away from what the Government proposes.  Our Bill set out that the board, in consultation with the Minister, would decide the number of appointments to the rank of chief superintendent and superintendent.  It gave flesh to the idea of an independent policing authority that would have a very hands-on approach at the highest and middle echelons of the Garda service, allowing the authority very much to put its stamp on the situation.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1126">As Deputy Wallace said, how can gardaí at any level of management operate when they are answerable to so many bodies?  It does not make practical sense.  They are responsible to the Government, the authority, the authority and the Government or the Commissioner, depending on their rank.  One body can appoint people and another can remove them.  If the authority is to be real and independent, it should have the full power to appoint and remove people.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1127">It should most definitely have full power over the appointment of the Garda Commissioner, subject only to consultation with the Government.  That does not mean the Government cannot veto an appointment, but its views should most definitely be taken on board.  The decision should be taken by the authority.  As Deputy Wallace said, how can the authority be responsible for systemic issues, overall policing and policy matters but not be in a position to appoint or remove those who are charged with implementing those policies and decisions?  It does not make practical sense.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1128">Existing regulations regarding promotions will continue, with the Minister and Commissioner at the helm, in terms of the various ranks and making decisions.  In some instances they may be decisions by proxy.  There is no change in the system.  It is as we were but worse, because there is the fig leaf of the pretence that we are doing something about it.  Every organisation, and I will deal with some of them, stated that the authority should have the power to appoint and remove other senior ranks.  This input was provided by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and others.  I remind the Minister of State of the Labour Party's Garda authority policy paper published last year, which also recommended that the authority should appoint the Garda Commissioner and other senior staff through open competition, and should be empowered to hold the Commissioner to account.  This is what the Labour Party produced in a policy paper last year but it is not what we are getting here.  It also spoke about preparing a policing plan with measurable targets, but none of these are in the final legislation as it stands.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1129">We have mentioned Northern Ireland on a few occasions, but let us look at the board there, because we should take cognisance of better practices than our own.  The Northern Ireland police authority has a clear primary function, set out in statute, to hold the Chief Constable and the Police Service of Northern Ireland publicly to account in the exercise of their functions, including police compliance with the Human Rights Act 1998, which is very much in stark contrast with the legislation we have before us.  The Northern Ireland Policing Board appoints, disciplines and dismisses the Chief Constable, the equivalent of our Garda Commissioner, and senior police officers of assistant chief constable level and above, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State.  The Secretary of State can, however, require the board to call upon the Chief Constable to retire.  The Northern Ireland authority has far greater power than is provided for in the Bill.  We have relied on some of the expert input into the process by people such as Professor Dermot Walsh and Dr. Vicky Conway.  Dr. Conway made the point that the role of the Minister should be transferred to the authority.  This is what the Bill should have been about in its entirety.  The authority's main function should be, as it is in Northern Ireland, to hold the Garda Commissioner to account in his or her functions, and to hold him or her accountable for the functions of those under his or her operational direction.  Obviously the Commissioner should still retain operational independence in the main function of directing or controlling the Garda Síochána.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1130">The authority must have responsibility for the appointment of the Commissioner.  Dr. Conway states that this should be with the approval of the Minister, but also that serious consideration should be given to allowing the authority to appoint other ranks, which is precisely the situation we included in our Bill.  The authority should also have the power to ask the Commissioner to retire.  She makes a very good point on making the Commissioner accountable.  She states that there can be no doubt that an empowered independent authority has the capacity to depoliticise policing in Ireland and make a substantive contribution to the governance and accountability of policing.  This is what we wanted out of the process.  She also stated that an authority which is not given specific powers, such as the setting of police plans, the determination of budgeting and the appointment of the Commissioner could, on the other hand, be a retrograde step for Irish policing, and this scenario would create a semblance of independence and accountability without the reality, just as was done with the creation of GSOC in the past decade.  This would be a disservice to Irish society and to the members of the Garda Síochána.  I totally and one hundred percent agree with the sentiment Dr. Conway put forward in these words, because we all know, and sadly many citizens know, that when people go to GSOC they do not get what they think they will get, which is a vehicle for calling the Garda to account.  It is a semblance on paper.  When we first engaged with GSOC we thought it was a body in collusion, working to cover up the activities of An Garda Síochána, and sadly many citizens believe this to be the case.  Our experience led us in a different direction, whereby we found this was not the case, but that the organisation itself was set up to fail.  It cannot do what it is supposed to do and this has made the situation worse.  People who are victims of crime and the victims of Garda malpractice have gone to GSOC looking for help but have found another door closed in their face.  This has made it even worse and, building on the points we made earlier about the independent review mechanism, it is really reprehensible.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1131">It is really important to speak about this part of the Act, on which most of the bodies which made an input commented.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is the Government's statutory body on human rights.  In fairness, it went to the trouble of making an input into this process.  It made it very clear the authority should have a disciplinary role regarding the Garda senior management, as the board does in the North.  This is not envisaged in the Bill before us, despite the fact that the Guerin report and the Garda Inspectorate report highlighted two overriding problems regarding the absence of internal disciplinary procedures at senior management level and the absence of ways to deal with underperformance at senior management level.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission recommended an alignment of disciplinary procedures flowing from GSOC investigations.  This was a really good and important contribution, because we should look at the problems highlighted by the Guerin and Garda Inspectorate reports.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1132">It is an open secret, as everyone will say, that when certain fellows go into the ranks of An Garda Síochána, one can almost tell in Templemore that they will rise to the top because their father was a chief superintendent or an assistant commissioner.  One can nearly hand-pick the fellows.  It is an open secret that it is about whom one plays golf with, whom one is friendly with and whether one is in the know, and that people look after matters for each other.  This type of insular, closed mentality exists and is something that many decent gardaí find very hard to deal with.  Many retired gardaí have come to us to say how unhappy they were with the functioning of the service and how they would have benefited from more accountability in this regard.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1133">Let us look at the hierarchy of An Garda Síochána at present.  We have a Garda Commissioner, two deputy commissioners and 12 assistant commissioners.  We know that at present a group of them, including the Garda Commissioner, a deputy commissioner and a number of the assistant commissioners, all came from one region in Galway, where they headed up the area.  They all ended up working closely together and rising to the top, almost like a little cartel.  They are a group within a group, and this is really dangerous.  I know the service is small but the point we are trying to make is that this insular behaviour is not good, and self-appointment and self-regulation do not work.  We know this, and it was most glaringly brought to light recently in the cases of the serving Garda whistleblowers and the instance highlighted on "This Week" a number of weeks ago.  A serving Garda whistleblower made a complaint to senior officers at assistant commissioner level at the behest of an investigation initiated by the Garda Commissioner.  Information was leaked back to the person against whom the complaint was made, this person being a friend of the assistant commissioner sitting on the panel.  The complainant made a complaint to the Commissioner about this, subsequent to which the Commissioner appointed the same assistant commissioner to investigate and conduct a disciplinary procedure regarding a complaint made by different garda against the same person to whom the information had been leaked.  Seriously, how in God's name could anybody have confidence in the service if this type of behaviour is going on?</p>
                    <p eId="para_1134">Self-regulation, or gardaí investigating themselves, no more than politicians or whoever else investigating themselves, does not work.  The whole purpose of the Bill is to have an independent authority which sets the scene on this.  It is interesting to see that the Irish Council for Civil Liberties also commented on this particular area of the Bill.  It recommended that the new authority should fill the gap in civic oversight and should have an oversight role in respect of Garda contracts, management and performance, the setting of clear performance goals for the Commissioner on an annual basis, and the appointment of senior gardaí up to and including the Commissioner, as well as a role in monitoring compliance with human rights and priorities.  That is what we could have had but instead we have a complete hodgepodge of different arrangements for different levels of Garda recruitment.  It is a recipe for absolute chaos.  It is not fair to gardaí at any level and it is unfair to the independent authority because it implies that it is not really independent or an authority but rather a rubber stamp that exists to give a bit of a nod and nothing more.  In some of the amendments we are dealing with, it is given the right to nominate a person.  It can put somebody forward but it cannot appoint anybody.  The authority does not have a say so the name it proffers can be ignored.  We know the Minister has the overall say with the promotions board having the right to nominate two people and the Garda Commissioner allowed to nominate one person.  It amounts to control by the Minister and the Garda Commissioner, as it is at the moment.  Now it will be a little bit by proxy but it is just not good enough.</p>

                    <from>Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn</from>
                    <p eId="para_1135">This is a large grouping of amendments so we are forced to speak to a range of them at the same time.  I imagine this will take considerable time.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1136">The first group of amendments I wish to speak to are amendments Nos. 9 to 13, inclusive and 15 to 21, inclusive.  These amendments are in line with the need for the authority to be truly independent.  The Minister should not be permitted to appoint the Garda Commissioner.  The role of the authority under this Bill in recommending the appointment is not strong enough and there should be an amendment to allow for the authority to appoint the Garda Commissioner directly.  If the Garda Commissioner is going to be accountable to the authority, the latter must have effective powers and mechanisms to oversee the appointment and removal of the Garda Commissioner.  These amendments would correct the Bill and achieve that objective.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1137">The next set of amendments includes amendments Nos. 23 to 35, inclusive.  In line with the need for the authority to be truly independent, the Minister should not be permitted to appoint the deputy Garda commissioner.  The role of the authority under this Bill in recommending the appointment is not strong enough.  This should be amended to allow for the authority to directly appoint a deputy Garda commissioner.  A deputy Garda commissioner will be accountable to the Garda Commissioner who is accountable to the authority.  The authority needs to have effective powers and mechanisms to oversee the appointment and removal of the deputy Garda commissioners.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1138">The next set of amendments includes amendments Nos. 37 to 62, inclusive.  These amendments relate to the need for the authority to have the power to appoint directly and remove ranks from superintendent up.  The Bill must be amended to reflect this.  Our objective is that the authority would oversee every promotion and appointment in An Garda Síochána, from sergeant right through to Garda Commissioner.  Right now, there is a view among members of An Garda Síochána that many promotions over the years were not down to meritocracy but rather who one knew.  That is not to slight every officer promoted, as there are many fine senior officers in An Garda Síochána.  That is a perception we must remove by putting in place oversight that is clearly independent and based on a meritocracy.  In a football team, if a player is picked based on performance, the entire team has belief and it is better for everybody.  If it is felt that somebody has not been appointed under a meritocracy, there is an impact on the morale.  That applies in the police service and, more important, the service delivered to the public, so we must deal with that.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1139">I will speak to amendment No. 62 which relates to the current provision allowing the Minister to hold, initiate and oversee inquiries on policing matters.  That must be amended to give this power to the authority.  Amendments No. 70 to 73, inclusive, are technical amendments in line with the new provisions relating to the removal of officers.  The basis of amendment No. 76 is to amend the Bill to provide that the Minister's consent is not required for appointment of civilian Garda staff and to give oversight to the authority in this regard.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1140">There is a list of all the powers retained by either the Minister or the Government over policing.  The temptation might be to justify these individually but consideration of the totality of this crucial list indicates the scale of control that remains centrally vested.  For example, the Garda Commissioner and deputy Garda commissioner will be appointed and removed by the Government.  The Garda Commissioner is accountable to the Government and it has been stated that the Garda Commissioner will remain accountable to the Government on matters of national security, but that is not accurate.  The original provision on accountability is not altered.  The Garda Commissioner will remain accountable to the Minister for the performance of the Garda Commissioner's functions and those of An Garda Síochána.  This concerns all aspects of policing and not just national security.  Policing plans, strategies and priorities must be confirmed by the Government according to the Bill and security priorities will be set by the Government.  The budget is also set by the Government.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1141">The Minister may demand any documents of An Garda Síochána and issue written directives to An Garda Síochána and the authority.  Closed circuit television schemes must be approved by the Minister and ministerial consent is required for the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission to investigate the Garda Commissioner.  The Minister decides the number of senior rank positions and consents to the number of civilian staff, the appointment of members to the audit committee and the appointment of the chief executive officer of the authority.  The Minister decides what constitutes State security.  Government consent is required for gardaí to work with a police service in another state and the Minister authorises delegation of the Garda Commissioner's functions to the deputy Garda Commissioner.  The Minister may appoint a person to inquire into any aspect of policing, and statistical information on crime compiled by An Garda Síochána is to go to the Minister and not the authority.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1142">Members can see that a serious set of powers is retained by the Government through the Minister.  We hoped the amendments from the Opposition could be engaged with but instead, for the fourth day in a row, that will not happen.  I have been justice spokesperson for three years now and I was foreign affairs spokesperson for my party before that, but I have never seen a case where there were two days of Committee Stage debate and two days of Report Stage debate with the Minister absent for all of them.  I say this with all due respect to the Minister of State present.  We have seen two Ministers of State, one of whom is loosely attached to the justice portfolio, but the Minister of State present has no attachment to justice.  It is outrageous that this happens when Opposition justice spokespersons have engaged in good faith and rightly have put much work into this Bill because it is of immense importance.  This is one of the important planks mentioned by the Government in the reform of An Garda Síochána arising from the various scandals going back to the Morris tribunal.  This is big stuff but we have not had a Minister before us.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1143">Do not give us the guff that the Minister is doing important business.  She has been doing so over recent days but we did not set the schedule, because the Government does that.  It is-----</p>

                    <p eId="para_1149">Okay.  That is fair enough.  I have made my point.  It is unprecedented and outrageous.  Many Ministers receive amendments.  We put a huge amount of work into our amendments and we engaged through all of it.  Unfortunately we were disadvantaged by the fact that the justice committee was scheduled for a date and time at which all the Opposition made clear we could not make it.  The committee still went ahead with only Government members present and the amendments we could not move that day have not been allowed on Report Stage.  The way the Opposition has been treated in respect of this legislation since Second Stage is unprecedented and outrageous.  That is why we are going to call a vote on every single amendment and take as long as we can to get this Bill through until the Minister comes back next week and engages with us seriously.  It is an insult how we have been treated regarding this.  It is also an insult to the many fine people who have been making submissions to the justice committee, who have attended various seminars and given their expert opinion.  It is not just us, as Opposition spokespersons, but also those outside who have given their contributions.  That is my contribution.  I appreciate the Acting Chairman's intervention and his guidance is accepted.</p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#AnnPhelan" eId="spk_440" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport,_Tourism_and_Sport">
                    <from>Deputy Ann Phelan</from>
                    <p eId="para_1150">Without wishing to repeat all the points raised in the detailed Committee Stage debate on these amendments, it is important to point out that the effect of the amendments would, in particular, be to remove from the Government and the Minister for Justice and Equality any role in the appointment or dismissal of members of the Garda Síochána.  In the course of drafting this Bill, the Attorney General has advised that, as a matter of custom, practice and proper constitutional interpretation, the function of the Garda Síochána in the exercise of the policing power of the State has been interpreted by the Courts as a function that is exercised as part of the Executive power of the State.  While an Executive power of the Government under Article 28.2 can be delegated, the advice is that it would not be constitutionally permissible for such a delegation to amount to an abdication of the Government's Executive power.  I want to emphasise that the exercise of the policing function is an aspect of the Executive power of the State.  Many of the opposition amendments proposed for this Bill would remove from the Government the ability to comply with the constitutional duties in relation to the exercise of that power.  That in itself would be unconstitutional.  Within this framework, the Attorney General has advised that any legislative proposal in relation to the establishment of a policing authority should preserve, ultimately, the power of the Government to appoint or to dismiss the Commissioner.  As Deputies will appreciate, in order to address the relevant constitutional concerns, the advice of the Attorney General is reflected in the provisions of the Bill. In view of of the importance of their functions, a similar approach has been adopted for deputy Garda commissioners.  When considering the amendments it is also necessary to take account of the fact that the Garda Síochána is the security service for the State.  Deputies will be aware that, under the Bill, the Garda Commissioner will continue to be accountable to the Government in respect of national security.  This approach has a wide measure of support within the Oireachtas.  It goes without saying that national security is a key function of the Government.  In the Minister’s view, leaving aside the very clear constitutional dimension, the appointment of the head of the national security service must rest with the Government.  For similar reasons, the Government must continue to have the capacity to remove senior Garda members on security grounds.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1151">While there are other issues I might raise in relation to the Deputies' amendments, at this point I believe I should concentrate on the functions that are being conferred on the policing authority by the Bill in respect of the appointment and removal of Garda personnel.  First, I would point out that, under the Bill, the authority will have a leading role in relation to a large body of Garda appointments.  This will operate, in particular, at the very highest levels of the Garda organisation.  It will also have general functions in the areas of Garda appointments and promotions.  With regard to the Garda Commissioner, or a deputy commissioner, all future appointments to these posts will be made solely on the basis of a nomination made by the authority following an open selection process undertaken by the Public Appointments Service.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1152">From an international perspective, it is very much the general practice that governments either make or must approve top-level police appointments.  For example, while the Chief Constable is appointed by the Northern Ireland Policing Board, the appointment must be approved by the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice.  Similar arrangements are also in place in Scotland, which has a recently established police authority.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1153">In the case of Garda personnel in the ranks from superintendent to assistant commissioner, the Bill provides that all the appointments will be made directly by the authority.  Additionally, the authority will appoint persons to positions within the Garda civilian staff which are equivalent to or above the rank of chief superintendent.  With regard to dismissals, and in line with the constitutional and security principles I outlined, the Garda Commissioner or a deputy commissioner will be removed by the Government.  At the same time, the authority will have the power to recommend to the Government that a Garda Commissioner or deputy commissioner be removed for policing reasons.  Dismissals of persons in the ranks of superintendent to assistant commissioner, for policing reasons, will be undertaken by the authority.  It will also be able to suspend a person from duty in advance of a removal decision.  While the Deputies’ amendments go beyond the appointment and dismissal of Garda personnel, it is important to make clear that the overall approach adopted by the Government to the Bill is that relevant functions should be transferred from the Government and the Minister to the authority where this is permissible and appropriate.  However, the transfer process has its limitations and it has, of course, to be undertaken against the general constitutional and policy backgrounds that I have highlighted.  Within these frameworks, for example, the Minister cannot, for substantial legal and policy reasons, accept a situation, as proposed in the amendments, where the Minister of the day would not be involved in determining the numbers of persons to be appointed to senior Garda ranks.  Accordingly, on behalf of the Minister, I ask the Deputies not to press the amendments.</p>

                <speech by="#MickWallace" eId="spk_441">
                    <from>Deputy Mick Wallace</from>
                    <p eId="para_1154">The point we have been making is that the new police authority should have full power of appointment of the Garda Commissioner, subject only to consultation with the Government.  We are not actually rubbing the Government's involvement in policing out of existence, but the Minister of State has said that what we are proposing would remove from the Government the power to control policing.  If she thinks that is what we are saying, she is right.  We do not think it is a good idea that the Government controls policing.  That is why so many people thought the idea of putting in place an independent police authority was a good one.  It would go some way towards taking policing out of total Government control.  Sadly, that is not what is happening.  Policing is going to remain in total Government control.  The authority is being given weak powers to make it look as if there is a buffer between the Government and the Garda Síochána.  However, it is so toothless that it is only going to complicate matters.  The Government is also going to make all the appointments to this board.  Even if it were not, it is giving it so little power.  It is a bit like the GSOC issue.  GSOC was designed to fail and this non-independent policing authority is also designed to fail.</p>

                <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_442">
                    <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
                    <p eId="para_1155">The Minister of State is again quoting the Attorney General.  As Deputy Wallace stated, we have read the Fennelly report.  I would not be too keen on quoting the Attorney General at any length.  In any case, we would like to see any opinion the Attorney General had because the references to this area in the Constitution are quite limited.  It does not get away from the issue that, if the Minister is saying that the only reason she must retain the power is because of the Constitution, surely it should have dawned on the Government that it should have gone to the people and looked to change the Constitution.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1156">We must look at the context of this.  The Taoiseach is heading up a special justice sub-committee which has met nine times since it was set up because of the attention on policing matters.  In the public domain, it is well known that policing is overtly politicised.  The people have a huge yearning that things might be different but instead the Minister is hiding behind the Constitution to say the Government will keep control, and that is the problem we have with it.  The Minister retains almost every power she had or a veto, approval or consent over the exercise of any shared power with the authority.  Even in instances where we are nodding the head and saying the authority has a bit of a say, the Minister still has a veto.  The authority has no power at all.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1157">It is a complete row back from the heads of the Bill and it is disappointing when one compares it with the authorities in other states.  Such authorities in other states consult the government, something we have no problem with, but those states do not allow the government to have a veto, which is the kernel of a politicised police force and the reason we wanted to bring in these changes.  The appointments process is being openly retained by the Government.  Regarding the Commissioner and the deputy, it is very disappointing.  Regarding the powers of the authority to appoint the assistant commissioners, chief superintendents and superintendents, which are only subject to regulations which exist, it is deceptive.  We would say the Minister is changing nothing in this, except making it more complex, more confusing and less accountable.</p>

                    <p eId="para_1158">I would add that gardaí themselves, through the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, have stated repeatedly that they want politics removed from policing.  It is not only the public who wants this following the episodes and the failure of the Department of Justice and Equality and Ministers to oversee An Garda Síochána adequately.  Gardaí themselves want this.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1159">It has not been a good period for the Attorney General.  In terms of the advice given in this matter, one may interpret that the Government has an executive responsibility in terms of security matters but to stretch it to all policing matters is an interesting interpretation of the Constitution.  An examination of the legal status of both individual gardaí and the Commissioner presents problems with fulfilling their functions within Article 28.  Gardaí have wide and discretionary powers to interfere with constitutional rights and they cannot be directed when and how to use those powers.  The function of the Commissioner is defined as directing and controlling An Garda Síochána and advising the Minister on policing and security matters.  Ministers have repeatedly declined to accept responsibility for decisions of the Commissioner as policies and practices are for the Commissioner to decide.  The Minister's role is to hold the Commissioner to account for performing these functions, not to have a hand in how they perform them.  Given the legal status of the Commissioner, the Minister and individual gardaí, it is difficult to conclude that policing is an executive function.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1160">I would like to see the Attorney General's advice in this matter.  Whatever argument one can make about security matters, and we need a separate policing and security apparatus in this State given that we have a unique situation where they are combined, it is a remarkable interpretation of the Constitution to stretch it to all policing matters as an executive function of Government.  Few academic legal experts, certainly, in the policing arena, would agree with that assessment.  It is remarkable.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1161">As Deputy Clare Daly stated, if the Minister was determined to separate politics and government from policing and this was her advice from the Attorney General, why did she not put this to a referendum?  The Government has held referendums on much less important matters in recent years.</p>

                    <p eId="para_1162">The core point, which has been articulated widely in both Houses, is that there are limits to the extent to which the executive power of the State in relation to policing can be delegated.  While the position is not being accepted by the Deputies, the legal advice provided by the Attorney General is clear.  The Bill has been developed taking into account the constitutional position.  In short, the Executive cannot remove itself from its responsibilities in relation to policing.</p>

                    <from>Deputy Mick Wallace</from>
                    <p eId="para_1166">First, in reply to the Minister of State's last comment, given the considerable importance of this area, to which Deputy Mac Lochlainn referred, if the Constitution is preventing the Government from doing right in relation to policing, let us fix the Constitution and put the necessary issues to the people with a view to changing them in order that we can conduct policing better.  It is a considerable challenge and we need to do it better.  It is imperative that we address the obstacles that may lie in the Constitution.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1167">The majority of this crazy bunch of amendments, numbering 74 in total, are under Part 2 dealing with the personnel and organisation of the Garda Síochána.  The two main sections deal with appointments and a code of ethics.  I have spoken on the appointments section.  With regard to the code of ethics, as we mentioned, under the 2005 Act, as amended, section 17 sets out that the Minister shall establish by regulation a code of ethics, including conduct and practice, for members of An Garda Síochána following consultation with the Commissioner, who prepares a draft code, and following consultation with bodies, such as the Ombudsman and the Irish Human Rights Commission, and having regard to European standards.  Neither this Minister nor any other Minister since 2005 has done this.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1168">The Government came to office in 2011 and stated it would do things differently.  It was a significant lapse of responsibility on the part of the previous Government that it did not address this issue.  The current Government was going to do things differently and was going to be the coalition of reform.  How was this completely ignored again for the best part of five years?</p>
                    <p eId="para_1169">The 2007 discipline regulations set out that a breach of any code of ethics, if one existed, would be a breach of discipline and dealt with it in accordance with the procedures thereunder.  The Garda Síochána (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2014 we introduced proposed that the board and the Commissioner would be responsible for the drafting of the code of ethics for the Minister to establish by regulation with the approval of the board and that a code of service would be drawn up setting out standards of efficiency and service the public could expect from gardaí.  Our Bill also inserted new sections 17A and 17B setting out that all Garda codes be published - another significant challenge that has gone ignored.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1170">The Minister's Bill proposes that the authority shall, within 12 months, establish a code of ethics that includes standards of conduct and practice for members and internal whistleblowing provisions.  However, the authority is obliged to consult more bodies than the Minister would have had to if she had ever drafted the code of ethics.  For example, the authority will have to consult the Garda unions whereas the Minister would not have had to under the 2005 Act.  The authority also has to consult the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  In addition to European policing standards, the authority must also have regard to the policing principles when drafting the code of ethics.  The clause that provides that a breach of the code of ethics is a breach of discipline, which was in the heads of the Bill published last autumn, is not in the final Bill.  The code of ethics as guidance for gardaí in carrying out their functions was included in very important new policing principles and has been removed from policing principles.  The 2007 discipline regulations ensure that a breach of the code of ethics, if it existed, would be a breach of discipline.  However, the regulations are only secondary legislation and can be revoked at any point by the Minister.  Regulations, when drafted or revoked, never come before the House for debate, but come under the exercise of the Minister's executive power.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1171">The 2007 discipline regulations were made pursuant to section 123 of the 2005 Act, and the Bill proposes to remove section 123(2)(<i>b</i>), which allows the Minister to make discipline regulations that relate to failure to comply with the provisions of the code of ethics under section 17.  The removal of section 123(2)(<i>b</i>) was not proposed in the draft heads.  The draft heads set out that a breach of the code of ethics would be a breach of discipline.  This is another serious and underhand row-back on what was promised.  This would be obvious only after a very detailed examination of the legislation and the Minister has not mentioned it in any of her press releases or radio interviews, in which she has made much of the code of ethics for which the authority will be responsible.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1172">Once the Bill has been passed, the reference to a breach of the code of ethics being a breach of discipline, set out in the 2007 regulations, will no longer be lawful.  It will no longer be legitimised by the parent Act, given that the relevant section 123(2)(<i>b</i>) will have been deleted.  It is a major failing of the legislation.  While the authority will introduce a code of ethics with great fanfare, breaching it will not be a breach of discipline, due to changes in the Act.  The fact that there will be no sanctions for breaching the code will make it meaningless.</p>
                    <p eId="para_1173">We have made many of the points.  We have prepared commentary on every amendment we have tabled.  I could go through them all, but it is hard to have the will sometimes.  We are just so disappointed.  We have put much work into this, as has Deputy Mac Lochlainn.  It beggars belief that the Government has had such a poor approach to it.  All the talk about real reform and doing things differently in policing was the talk of the day 18 months ago.  The Government agreed there were problems in policing and said it would address them and it could not be left as it was.  However, we are getting more of the same.</p>

                        <p eId="para_2454">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, for taking this issue.  It has been a difficult task over the past few years as we are talking about children and specifically the education of children, with funding coming through the Health Service Executive.  Really, the issue spans three Departments but I am focusing on support and funding, which comes under the Department of Health.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2455">It is safe to say that early years are some of the most important in our lives.  In particular, the preschool years are so important when it comes to children's learning.  Children are constantly learning new things.  They are constantly developing as young children and they develop new friendships outside the family.  Until they reach a certain age, their families provides all the support needed, but it is important that children be allowed to create their own identities and to grow.  It is equally important that they grow and develop with their own peers, in an environment with other young children.  Nobody, whether he or she has a physical disability, a mental disability, a health problem or any other kind of problem, should be left behind.  Everybody should be given the same opportunity.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2456">This Government has turned the focus back onto children.  We are the first Government to create a Department specifically for children and young people and that is particularly important to me.  A large part of my week is spent focusing on issues relating to children and young adults.  The previous Government introduced the free early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme, which has worked very well, and I am glad to see that our Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, has extended that this year, among other initiatives focusing on children and their development.  I thank the Minister for the work he has done in the past year and in particular for the recent additional funding to help those with disabilities to access this free year.  There must be equal inclusion for all.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2457">In my own county we have Meath Fight for the Future, an organisation made up of mothers, fathers, carers and service providers fighting for the rights of their children and other children with special needs.  While there should not be groups such as this, there are, and I hope their time will soon be done.  At the moment, children in Meath who have a disability are getting funding through the HSE to avail of additional supports, so the 15 hours are often split over the two years.  Some are getting two days in one year and three in the following year.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2458">The Minister has announced an additional €10 million in funding and he is launching the report of the interdepartmental group, which will set out the model for the support soon enough.  However, we have a situation in Meath in which there are six children who have no additional support and no additional funding.  While the funding was not cut this year, due mainly to the campaign led by Meath Fight for the Future - I thank the HSE for the support it is providing - 15 children are not getting any funding this year and there are more children who need to avail of the additional support.  Not only are they not getting the 15 hours, they are not even getting the two days, and it is not fair.  It is extremely stressful and upsetting for parents and for the children themselves.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2459">Children are smart; they pick up on the smallest of things.  In fact, they pick up on everything.  For a child not to be able to avail of the free ECCE year along with his or her peers is not right.  It is not going to cost a lot of money.  We are not talking about hundreds of children - we are talking about six - so surely some funding can be found until next year, when the scheme is properly brought in, so that these children are not left wanting.  I welcome the fact that things are going to happen next year, but parents should not have to suffer for it this year.  I ask the Minister to help in any way he can or to consider some form of support for these children.</p>

                        <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach  (Deputy Dara Murphy)</from>
                        <p eId="para_2460">I thank Deputy McEntee for raising this important matter.  The ECCE programme is the responsibility of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  While a certain flexibility has been built in to the programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability, the children and young people's policy framework, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, contained a commitment to develop a plan to facilitate the full participation of such children in the ECCE programme.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has led responsibility for the implementation of this commitment and has concluded an intensive process of deliberation and consultation on the matter in conjunction with the Departments of Health and Education and Skills and has brought forward a new model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE programme.  As part of budget 2016, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs announced the necessary funding to implement the new model of ECCE supports for children with a disability.  The new model will provide supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners, grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations, and access to therapeutic intervention.  Funding of €15 million has been provided to phase these supports in during 2016.  Full-year costs for these supports are estimated at €33 million from 2017 onwards.  Full details of the new model are due to be announced shortly.  Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Building on additional investment in recent years, funding of €8 million is being provided to the HSE in 2016 to expand,<i>inter alia</i>, the provision of speech and language therapy in primary care and the further development of early intervention therapy services under the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream preschool settings as part of the roll-out of the new inclusive preschools model.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2461">As the Deputy will be aware, the HSE has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the free preschool year.  However, it has worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  In some limited cases at local level, such as in Meath, HSE disability services have facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream preschools by providing assistant supports where possible and where resources allow.  The HSE's Meath disability service has a budget of €267,200 for its<i>ad hoc</i> preschool supports programme.  Under the arrangements currently in place, children with disabilities are assessed, in the first instance, to identify their preschool support needs, and decisions about which children qualify for supports are made in the summer before the children start preschool in September.  The amount of funding or subsidy allocated to each child is dependent on the total number of approved applications in a given year.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2462">The HSE has advised that 129 applications for preschool assistant supports were received by its Meath disability services for the 2015-2016 preschool year, 100 of which were approved.  Of the 29 unapproved applications, I understand that six were turned down on the basis of having been received past the deadline for submitting applications.  The HSE has indicated that unfortunately, because the budget has been exhausted, it is not in a position to increase the value of the<i>ad hoc</i> preschool assistant support subsidy in Meath, or to cater for the late applications.</p>

                        <p eId="para_2463">I thank the Minister for his response.  One term stands out to me, namely "<i>ad hoc</i>.”  Up to now, much of this has been <i>ad hoc</i> - based on individual counties, HSE departments and disability services - and it has been up to the individual groups to provide the service as they saw fit.  We have been very lucky in Meath that the HSE disability service has provided this funding.  I know the Minister of State said some applications were not submitted in time, but we are talking about six children.  A system has now been put in place and I thank the Minister and all the different Departments for this, as it has been a cross-departmental effort to put it in place.  The additional funding has been secured and they really engaged with all the different groups.  I know from working with Meath Fight for the Future that this group met with the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and many of their concerns have been taken on board.  I am sure that has happened across the board.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2464">I stress that we are talking about six children.  It is not a lot of money.  The funding is coming through the HSE and, while it is saying it cannot do this at a local level, I am asking at a national level whether this funding can be made available.  Ten months is a long time in the life of a child and that is what we are talking about between now and next September.  If the Minister of State could relay this to the Minister, I would appreciate it.  We are talking about six children here.  It is not a lot of money and it is not something that would be sought again next year.  It is just for ten months.</p>

                        <p eId="para_2466">Unfortunately, the HSE, for which this is a matter, has also stated that the budget has been exhausted and, therefore, it is not in a position at this stage to consider late applications.  The Meath disability service has a budget in excess of €250,000 but, as Deputy McEntee has requested, I certainly will convey her ongoing concern to the Minister.</p>

                    <speech by="#BillyKelleher" eId="spk_498">
                        <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher</from>
                        <p eId="para_2467">I raise the issue of the necessity to commission another report of sexual abuse and violence in Ireland, SAVI.  The original report was published in 2002 and it was the foundation on which the Ferns, Ryan, Murphy and Cloyne reports were delivered.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2468">I note the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and others are keen to have a second SAVI research report conducted.  Interestingly, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality also strongly recommends that a second SAVI report be commissioned.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2469">The previous report was commissioned 13 years ago by the Department of Health, and the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was also involved.  This is being moved from Department to Department.  The various Departments say it is somebody else's responsibility.  We need a Minister to take ownership of this issue and commission another report.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2470">The rape crisis centre has lobbied the Minister for Health, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Minister for Education and Skills but none of them saw it as their responsibility.  The only positive response to date has been from the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who is to be complimented on that.  I raise it in the hope that it can be delivered.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2471">The 2002 SAVI report told us that over the lifetime of Irish women and men, 200,000 women and 60,000 men are victims of rape.  Surely those figures are alarming and would indicate that it is a national crisis.  Over the 13 years since the SAVI report was published, the national policy has been informed by the results and a number of the recommendations of SAVI have been implemented.  For example, there are now six sexual assault treatment units in the country, two more than pre-SAVI.  There is still a long way to go.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2472">COSC, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, has delivered its first four-year national strategy and it has also funded small awareness-raising campaigns.  There has also been a significant increase in the number of victims availing of the rape crisis centres around the country which are vastly under-funded, something else of which we should be conscious.  The Dublin Rape Crisis Centre manages a 24 hour national helpline and in 2014 it dealt with over 12,000 calls.  Over the weeks after the launch of various high profile reports, such as Ferns, Cloyne and Murphy, the number of calls significantly rise.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2473">This is the important issue.  Until the detailed research for a second SAVI is done, we will not know if these increases are due to a rise in the prevalence of the crime or to the victims coming forward feeling that their concerns will be listened to and their stories taken into account and acted upon.  Until such time as we have that detailed research, we are in the dark in terms of what is happening in broader Irish society.  It is quite an alarming statistic that over the lifetime of Irish women and men, 200,000 women and 60,000 men are raped.  Behind those statistics there are harrowing stories indeed.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2474">We also need a second SAVI that can properly inform policy development.  As the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality pointed out, a new SAVI research report could review the implementation of the recommendations contained in the original one because some of the recommendations have been acted on but many more have not been.  I believe there is piecemeal assessment of the addressing of rape, domestic violence and other forms of violence.  It is simply not acceptable that we have a situation where every Department is inclined to say that it is somebody else's fault.  This is, collectively, a Government responsibility and what we need is for a Department to take ownership of it and accept that another report must be commissioned.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2475">We are talking about a cost of approximately €1 million.  With the prevalence of violence against women and men, in terms of rape, domestic violence and sexual abuse, we cannot pretend that it is not an issue.  Getting a report commissioned and published would at least put us on a platform towards further policy development and implementing the recommendations of a new report.</p>
                    </speech>
                    <speech by="#DaraMurphy" eId="spk_499">
                        <from>Deputy Dara Murphy</from>
                        <p eId="para_2476">I welcome this question from Deputy Kelleher.  I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality who is unavailable as she is attending the migration summit of EU and African leaders in Valletta.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2477">It is some time since the Sexual Abuse and Violence in Ireland report was published.  This was a fundamental piece of research, involving telephone interviews with over 3,000 persons.  Its results had a significant impact, both at the time of its publication in 2001 and since.  SAVI showed that more than four in ten or 42% of women and over a quarter or 28% of men reported some form of sexual abuse or assault in their lifetime.  Over one fifth or 23.6% of those who perpetrated sexual violence against women were intimate partners or ex-partners.  For male victims, the main perpetrators were friends and acquaintances, at 42%.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2478">Last year, the Department of Justice and Equality received a formal proposal from the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre in relation to the commissioning of an updated SAVI report.  I welcome the Deputy's comments about the engagement of the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, in these issues.  A new study will show the prevalence of and attitudes to sexual violence and show how the experience has changed since SAVI.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2479">The Minister has also secured additional funding in the budget for a national awareness-raising campaign in 2016, with a view to reducing the impact of such violence and to changing societal attitudes to such violence.  In September of last year, the Minister met the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  As a result, an updated proposal was submitted by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and Professor Hannah McGee of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  The overall cost of a report is likely to be in the order of €1 million over three years.  That proposal recognised that, given the significant budget, funding would be divided between four Departments, namely the Department of Justice and Equality but also the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, and Health.  That is not to diminish ownership by one Minister but rather to acknowledge that this is an issue that spreads across many Departments.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2480">The Minister has written to the relevant Ministers on this matter and expressed her support for the project.  The responses received thus far make the viability of the project, as proposed, unlikely.  However, the Department of Justice and Equality continues to investigate the financial feasibility and resource implications of undertaking this body of work at this time and to explore obligations with regard to requisite public procurement arrangements.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2481">The Minister for Justice and Equality is strongly supportive of a second SAVI.  The need for an evidence-based approach to policy-making is obvious.  In that respect, a balance must also be struck between funding front-line services, including services provided by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, and funding research.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2482">There are also a number of alternative sources of information to a second SAVI, and we do have available some data.  The European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, FRA, study on the prevalence of violence against women was published last year.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2483">The Minister for Justice and Equality clearly recognises the importance of research in this area.  In that regard, she is continuing to explore possible approaches to identifying a ring-fenced funding stream in this area which could be used to meet public policy objectives as required.</p>

                        <p eId="para_2484">As Benjamin Franklin once said, if you fail to plan, you are planning to fail.  The difficulty, of course, is that in developing a plan or policy in such a key area of society, one needs to have research.  One needs to know what is happening in society, the change in trends, the attitudes of people and the confidence of people in the institutions to which they would present if they were victims of rape, domestic violence or abuse.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2485">We all accept the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and other organisations are under-funded as it is.  They need more front-line resources but that is not a reason to refuse to look at the research and evidence base that would be required to ensure we can put the resources directly in the areas where they are most needed.  The figures presented by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, and other centres throughout the country, indicate that it is a societal problem that needs to be addressed and supported in every way.  We cannot trundle along, waiting year after year for the report to be commissioned, not knowing whether or not the policies in place are having an impact on reducing the crime or giving those who have been raped, abused or suffered violence the confidence to come forward.  We need to know.  We still hear about cases where people are reluctant to make statements, for many reasons.  We must get behind it.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2486">We cannot choose between funding either the Rape Crisis Centres or other agencies to provide front-line supports or the research.  The research must be done as a stand-alone project.  The previous SAVI served well in terms of developing policy, and we need an update.  I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister for Justice and Equality my support, and that of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and many others, for her to take ownership of it.  She should take ownership of it completely and ensure the funding is provided through the Department of Justice and Equality or the other three Departments involved, namely, the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, and Health.</p>

                        <p eId="para_2487">I will convey the Deputy's comments to the Minister.  Great use was made of the SAVI report.  It was an important body of work which highlights the extent and nature of sexual violence in Ireland.  In the meantime, other data has become available, including the study by the Fundamental Rights Agency.  This research has supported the development of the second national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, which the Minister for Justice and Equality intends to publish shortly, and an action plan which, when completed, will enable Ireland to ratify the Istanbul Convention.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is strongly supportive of an updated SAVI report.  Such a study would provide contemporary information on the prevalence of what is, and has been, often hidden in Ireland.  We would have a measure of what had changed during the past decade across society as well as information on the new challenges that had emerged.  The costs of undertaking this research are significant and, as I indicated and as the Deputy suggested, the Department of Justice and Equality continues to explore possible approaches to identifying a ring-fenced funding stream in the area which could be used.  I will pass on the Deputy's request that it be done, given that there is no disagreement between his point and the Department's reply.</p>

                        <p eId="para_2488">I thank the Minister of State for taking my Topical Issue.  My remarks are addressed not personally to the Minister of State, but to the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, as the people who brought forward the new housing package on stabilising rents and boosting supply this week.  The package includes a number of good measures which people can rightly welcome, such as the extended period for rent reviews, longer notice of rent reviews and the increased role of the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, in giving tenants extra certainty, challenging rent increases and providing oversight for landlords and tenants.  The measures will help Galway.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2489">During the boom, Galway city did not create vast ghost estates or overbuild.  Rather, the authorities there were careful and cautious.  As a result, when the downturn happened, we had one small ghost estate, the position in respect of which was remedied quickly thanks to the then Minister with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, who secured funding for it.  However, this means that as the economy has improved, the housing shortage in Galway has been particularly significant.  Rent for a three-bed semi-detached house increased from €800 per month in 2011 to €1,200 per month at present, a 50% increase in some cases.  The level of increase has been even higher in some parts of the city.  Houses that were selling for €160,000 or €180,000 are now being sold for €220,000 to €240,000, which is a staggering increase.  During the past four to five years, a maximum of 240 houses have been built in Galway city.  Many of them were one-off projects built by people with sites.  There is no serious housing construction of any kind, with the exception of one or two properties being developed by NAMA.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2490">I had hoped the report would contain ambitious measures for an increase in housing supply in Galway, bearing in mind that last year's Housing Agency report on housing supply requirements in Ireland stated that between 2015 and 2018, Galway city would require an additional 2,300 units in order to keep up with demand and prevent a crisis.  We have already reached crisis point but this number of units would ameliorate the position by increasing supply.  The document published this week, to much fanfare, acknowledges that "a major contributing factor to the current rental crisis is the lack of sufficient construction activity in the Dublin and Cork regions".  While I will not deny there is insufficient construction activity in the Dublin and Cork regions, there is also a severe lack of construction - indeed a total absence of construction - in Galway city.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2491">Galway is not a rural town in the west.  It is, rather, a regional capital which deserves to be treated like the serious urban centre it is.  It is the regional capital of the west and has the same problems in respect of housing construction and supply as Dublin and Cork.  If the Department is waiting for Galway to reach the same crisis point as Dublin, this is the way to go.  If it wants to have some kind of long-term vision, it must realise that we already have 12 families per week presenting as homeless and major supply problems.  The bias in the social housing programme towards Cork and Dublin is already evident.  It is unacceptable that the third largest city in Ireland should be excluded from measures to increase housing supply while Dublin and Cork are treated as the only urban areas, and I want it changed.</p>

                        <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government  (Deputy Ann Phelan)</from>
                        <p eId="para_2492">As the Deputy will be aware, housing is one of the most pressing issues facing our country.  Our economy has recovered even faster than we might have hoped at the start of our Administration and one of the implications of the recovery and the employment growth it has delivered has been a resurgent demand for housing, principally in the areas that first experienced the benefit of the recovery, particularly Dublin and Cork.  Construction, or an unsustainable reliance on it as a driver, rather than facilitator, of our economy, played a dominant role in our previous economic collapse and is the sector taking the longest to restructure.  Accordingly, the Government has put in place a range of initiatives to address the gap that has emerged between housing demand and supply.  The Government's Construction 2020 strategy foresaw the difficulties and specifically mandated my Department to establish a Dublin housing supply and co-ordination task force.  While the Construction 2020 measures will begin to have wider effects in reducing costs and improving affordability from 2018 onwards, analysis has shown that an even more immediate and short-term initiative is required in Dublin and Cork.  The latest figures for Dublin, for example, show that house completions for the first nine months of 2015 were down 14% on the first nine months of 2014 and are likely to meet just one third of requirements.  Analysis undertaken by the Dublin housing supply and co-ordination task force and other local authorities at the same time shows that there is planning permission for 21,000 units across the four Dublin local authorities and for 3,000 units in Cork.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2493">I would like to address the Deputy's issues in Galway.  The authorities in the city are to be congratulated on keeping a measured approach to housing during the Celtic tiger period.  Perhaps having just one ghost estate is something to be extremely proud of.  The Government has decided to introduce supply-related measures.  I refer to the time-limited development contribution rebate, which is designed to enhance the viability of construction at locations of greatest need and at price points that people can afford.  Therefore, this initiative is logically targeted at the Dublin local authority areas and at Cork city and suburbs.  It has already been mentioned that the inadequacy of supply of affordable housing is most acute in such areas.  The development contribution rebate is an aspect of the Government's overall package on housing that is targeted in Dublin and Cork for housing delivered at certain price points.  This package, which contains a broader range of measures to stimulate and facilitate the provision of housing supply nationally, will benefit all areas and regional cities, including Galway.  These measures include changes to planning guidelines on apartment standards.  The State's strategic investment fund will support the delivery of enabling infrastructure.  Measures are being introduced to maximise the potential of strategic development zones.  NAMA is introducing measures to finance the delivery of 20,000 residential units by 2020.  I will conclude by reiterating that with the exception of the development contribution rebate, the Government's actions on the urgent and pressing issue of housing development will support regional cities like Galway.</p>

                        <p eId="para_2495">I want the official in the Department of Finance who decided not to spend this money on Galway or Limerick to listen carefully.  I emphasise that my remarks are not directed at the Minister of State, but at an official who is presumably in an office somewhere watching this debate.  It is an absolute nonsense to say that this "initiative is logically targeted at the Dublin local authority areas and at Cork" because the inadequacy of supply "is most acute" in such areas.  As I have said, there has been damn all construction in Galway for five years.  It is in the middle of a housing crisis which is just as acute as that in Dublin and Cork.  Galway is a regional capital, as opposed to a regional city.  I suggest that the relevant officials need to get out of Dublin every so often.  If they go to Galway, they can go to the local authority offices and see for themselves the price escalations, the rent increases and the complete lack of construction that is taking place.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2496">I assume legislation will have to be introduced to enable this measure to be advanced.  If so, I will target it at every stage to seek to amend it.  I will do everything I can to lobby to get Galway and possibly Limerick included in this scheme.  I am sure people from Limerick are affected by this crisis.  According to the Housing Agency, Galway needs 2,300 houses by 2018.  No houses are being built at present.  To me, that is an indication that something is seriously wrong, as is the fact that, to be frank, these supports are being focused on cities that have Ministers.  I want Galway to be included in this report.  The current proposal is not fair.  We have been subjected to this kind of anti-west of Ireland discrimination for long enough.  I want this to change.  If one lives in Galway and wants to buy a house in Galway or get a local authority house in Galway, that does not mean one is any different from anyone in Cork or Dublin.  If representatives of the Department want to tell me that the number of houses in Galway which can benefit from this scheme is quite small, I will say "then it will not cost very much at all" and that is how we will sort it.  I want answers from the Ministers for the Environment, Community and Local Government and Finance.  How do they propose to change this measure to ensure the people of Galway, who deserve to be treated equally on this matter, are included in it as is only right?</p>

I will speak to the Minister, Deputy Kelly, about this issue, which relates to Galway and other areas throughout the country.  I remind Deputy Nolan that when we debated the housing crisis in this House some months ago, he described it as a "perfect storm".  I know he is well aware of the pressure that is encountered when efforts are made to respond to housing situations.  These pressure is one of the legacy issues inherited by this Government from the previous Administration, which left it to the private sector to provide all house-building.</p>

                        <p eId="para_2500">A range of housing supply measures involving the private rented sector were announced earlier this week.  These measures are designed to give rent certainty to tenants, to better protect tenants in their homes and to provide clarity to tenants and landlords across the country regarding their rights and obligations.  Under the social housing strategy, there are substantial targets and funding resources for the delivery of social housing by local authorities, including Galway City Council.  We are confident that a supply response will be forthcoming.  The challenge now is for the construction sector to respond.  It is time to see what that sector can deliver.  I will undertake to bring the issue raised by Deputy Nolan to the Minister, Deputy Kelly.</p>

                        <p eId="para_2501">The two schools to which this Topical Issue relates are in the Dublin West area, which has a particular shortage of schools.  This crisis has lasted for over a decade.  The population of this area has increased significantly over the past 15 years.  A substantial number of houses were built in the area during the building boom, but schools and other necessary facilities did not follow.  The local community is still paying the price for that.  Nine or ten years ago, the then Government promised two schools in the area, St. Mochta's national school in Clonsilla and St. Patrick's junior national school in Corduff, that they would get new school buildings.  Those promises were subsequently restated by the Government.  Nine years on, there is no sign of those buildings.  The children are being taught in Third World conditions, in essence, with leaking roofs, poor lighting and cold working conditions.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2502">In 2006, the authorities at St. Mochta's national school in Clonsilla were approached by the Department of Education and Science and asked to take on an extra stream in each year.  The school did not move from three streams to four streams per year of its own volition but because it was asked by the Department to do so.  This meant that the number of children in the school increased by more than 240.  The school's board of management, having been promised that the school would be fast-tracked through a building and development programme, agreed in very good faith to take these extra children on that basis.  There are 16 classrooms in an old school building that needs to be replaced and a further 16 classes in prefabs outside.  It is absolutely disgraceful that 884 children are being taught in such conditions.  It is an absolutely giant primary school, by any standards.  I do not want the Minister of State, Deputy English, to spend his time telling me about how the school can apply for emergency works or summer works to deal with leaking roofs, etc.  We have received such answers in written form.  The school authorities want to know whether the school will be on the list next week, after nine years of being promised a new school building.  That is all they want to know.  I hope the Minister of State will focus on that when he responds.  The school has had minor works.  It has been declined emergency works on occasion.  Those involved with the school want to know whether it will be on the list.  They want to be able to bring the school together at some point, rather than having to stagger breaks and get-togethers, etc.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2503">The Department said eight years ago that the second school I am raising, St. Patrick's national school in Corduff, was beyond repair and was no longer fit for people to be taught in.  The Department also said it was more economically viable to take the school down and build a new one.  Safety should be the key priority, one would imagine.  That school has also been told that it is at stage 2b and that everything is in order.  However, it has not been given permission to go to the tendering stage and has not been put on the new list.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2504">I wish to outline quickly what the children in that school are dealing with.  The school has no insulation so from November until April the teachers and students sit with their coats on.  This is in the recovering Ireland.  The school spends all of its capitation grant on oil to heat the building and the school is constantly in the red.  Electricians have said that the school is not safe, which is a health and safety issue.  There are interactive whiteboards which cannot be used because the electrical system is not able for it.  To add insult to injury, there are also sewerage problems and drainage companies have been on site continuously.  Children and staff have to endure a continuous bad smell.  Does the Minister of State believe that this is going on?  I listened to the previous speaker talking about Dublin getting this, that and the other but we have two Government Ministers in Dublin West and this is the condition of schools in that area.  They have not delivered a solitary thing for one of the fastest growing areas in the city.  Corduff, by the way, is a disadvantaged area with sufficient problems already without putting children through this too.</p>

                        <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills  (Deputy Damien English)</from>
                        <p eId="para_2505">I thank Deputy Coppinger for raising the matter again.  We had discussions previously about how bad planning has had a major affect on her area in the context of the provision of education places, given the number of houses that have been built there.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter again.  Deputy Coppinger has argued that previous governments have made promises but this Government has not done that.  We have tried to reform the system of delivery of education places, which hopefully will result in the correction of the shortage of places in most areas such as Dublin West and other key places.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2506">Again, I thank her for raising the matter as it gives me the opportunity to remind the House of the significant challenges facing the Department in terms of meeting increasing demand for pupil places throughout the country in the coming years and to clarify the current position on the major capital projects for St. Patrick's national school, Corduff and St. Mochta's national school.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2507">As the Deputy will be aware, significant capital funding will be invested in our education system through the Government's €27 billion capital programme announced in September, with some €3.8 billion being invested in education projects.  The new construction plan for 2016 to 2021 aims to prioritise new building projects and major extensions, including special schools, in areas where significant demographic need has been established.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2508">The Deputy will also be aware that the country has experienced an unprecedented population increase in recent years.  This demographic growth has posed a significant challenge for the provision of school places and the challenge is set to continue.  My Department's demographic projections show that enrolment at primary level will continue to increase substantially until at least 2019 while the demand for additional school places in the post-primary sector will continue to increase until at least 2022.  The new plan will give my Department the capacity to deliver some 19,000 additional permanent primary school places required by 2019 and 43,000 additional post-primary school places required by 2022.  The new plan also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms for schools outside the plan where an immediate enrolment need has been identified, such as the appointment of an additional teacher.  In addition, the plan prioritises projects that have a major deficit of mainstream accommodation capacity for current enrolments, require major refurbishment and replacement of poor accommodation and to provide additional accommodation to meet increases in enrolments.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2509">I wish to advise the Deputy that both major building projects referenced are currently at an advanced stage of architectural planning, stage 2b, which includes applications for planning permission, a fire safety certificate, a disability access certificate and the preparation of tender documents.  All statutory approvals have been secured.  The design team has recently completed tender documents for the St. Patrick's junior and senior national schools project to provide the new accommodation on the existing site, with stage 2b approved.  The project for St. Mochta's national school entails the construction of an extension to the existing building and refurbishment.  The design team is in the process of completing tender documents.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2510">While it was not possible to include the projects referred to by the Deputy in the current five-year building programme, I wish to advise the Deputy that the projects will be available for consideration for the new six-year plan that we intend to announce shortly.  I know Deputy Coppinger would like me to tell her today that they are included in that plan but I am not in a position to do so.  Much research has gone into making decisions and the plan is very close to completion.  It will be announced in the coming weeks and hopefully if, as Deputy Coppinger has said, the need is very clear, that will put those projects ahead of the game.  They are in a good position to be included in the next plan and hopefully we will be able to deliver on that.  The plan is all about trying to respond to the need for additional accommodation.  Hopefully the two schools referred to by Deputy Coppinger will be included but I cannot confirm that now.  I wish I could give her a definitive answer today but I cannot.</p>

                        <p eId="para_2511">That is simply not good enough.  It is not enough to say that St. Patrick's and St. Mochta's will be available for consideration.  They must be on that new list.  They have been promised it for nine years now.  We keep hearing that Ireland is in recovery and there is no excuse for the Government to delay this any longer.  It is not just a question of bad planning and promises made by previous regimes.  Myself and Deputy Joe Higgins are sick, sore and tired of attending meetings in St. Mochta's over the years, where Ministers, including some from the current Government, promised the community that they would ensure those projects would become a reality.  I attended those public meetings myself during local election and by-election campaigns and so forth.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2512">If those schools are not on the new list, I will call on parents and teachers to use their votes in the forthcoming election and to make sure they mobilise their communities.  I will also call on them to refuse to put children, teachers, SNAs and other employees through this any longer and to consider taking the extra 300 children who were enrolled out of the school in protest.  Why should children suffer for broken promises by the establishment parties in Dublin West?  There are other schools in the area, including Mary Help of Christians on the Navan Road, where children are in prefabs.  We also need the Rathborne Educate Together school on the Navan Road to be built.  The other crisis looming in the area is secondary school places.  Even though there has been a catch up in terms of some of the primary schools, the school community has grown older.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2513">It is not acceptable that children should go to a school where there are buckets in the corridors to collect rainwater.  Does the Minister of State think it is acceptable?  Does he think it is acceptable that children should wear their coats in class and that all of the funding for a school in a hard-pressed working class community is spent on heating a draughty school, rather than on resources such as computers which other schools in more well-heeled areas have?</p>
                        <p eId="para_2514">It is scandalous that the Department of Education and Skills approached the board of management at St. Mochta's and asked the members to take on additional pupils.  They did so in good faith but they have been spurned and shunned again and again.  I will make sure that the people of Dublin West use their political power in the forthcoming election and mobilise the community to get these two schools built.</p>

                        <p eId="para_2515">In terms of the two schools to which the Deputy refers, the concerns and issues with the Department are well rehearsed.  The Deputy is right - the conditions in which the pupils are being educated are not acceptable.  It is the aim of the Department to reform the system to be able to maximise the use of public finances to provide accommodation where it is required in the first instance, that is, to be able to give all students enrolling for the first time in primary or secondary school a place to go to school.  That is the key priority.  Our second priority is to make sure that such accommodation is suitable.</p>
                        <p eId="para_2516">I am glad that Deputy Coppinger is now admitting that this country is in recovery.  Thankfully, that jobs-based recovery means that we are in a position to announce in the coming weeks a major capital investment plan in our schools, both new and existing.  That is important and could not be achieved if we did not have a jobs-based recovery, which gives us the finances to do that.  I hope we can stretch those finances as far as possible.  The extra money that is now available will mean that additional schools will be built and extra accommodation provided.  Hopefully those additional resources will allow us to resolve some of the problems the Deputy has raised.  I am sure Deputy Coppinger will agree with that.  A key part of investing in education is that it will gives us jobs for the future and allow us to continue investing in education down the line.  I am glad the Deputy has finally admitted that the Government is doing something right with the recovery, which leaves us in a position-----</p>
